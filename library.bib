abstract = {Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has emerged as a viable power source for Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Expansion of the power transfer range is an important challenge to enable the design of efficient networks of small autonomous devices and drive the massive numbers of devices using a single wireless power source. Several signal design strategies have been proposed and verified to maximize the output DC power at the receiver under a transmit power constraint. In this paper, we study channel-adaptive beamforming and waveform to expand the power transfer range as well as output DC power performance. To that end, we have designed, prototyped a far-field WPT system and established a WPT testbed in a realistic indoor environment. The experiments have been conducted in a variety of wireless channel conditions in an indoor office environment with various distances. The measurement data have been fitted using simple analytical model to analyze the output DC power and achievable range improvement depending on the signal design schemes and the number of tones and antennas. The model shows a clear relationship between signal design versus output DC power and achievable range, and enables to predict the achievable power transfer range for given transmit power constraint and target received DC power. Results highlight the significant benefit of a channel-adaptive joint beamforming and waveform architecture to expand the power transfer range.},

abstract = {In this paper, an improved analytical model for diode efficiency in microwave rectifier is presented. This model provides a simple calculation routine to determine the input power level at which the peak reverse voltage across the diode starts to exceed the diode breakdown voltage when the diode efficiency starts to decrease. After studying the origins of the power losses in a shunt connected diode rectifier carefully, closed-form equations are derived to calculate the diode efficiencies at various input power levels. A 2.45 GHz microwave rectifier is designed and measured. The experimental results agree well with the proposed model prediction. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {MIMO processing plays a central part in the recent increase in spectral and energy efficiencies of wireless networks. MIMO has grown beyond the original point-to-point channel and nowadays refers to a diverse range of centralized and distributed deployments. The fundamental bottleneck toward enormous spectral and energy efficiency benefits in multiuser MIMO networks lies in a huge demand for accurate CSIT. This has become increasingly difficult to satisfy due to the increasing number of antennas and access points in next generation wireless networks relying on dense heterogeneous networks and transmitters equipped with a large number of antennas. CSIT inaccuracy results in a multi-user interference problem that is the primary bottleneck of MIMO wireless networks. Looking backward, the problem has been to strive to apply techniques designed for perfect CSIT to scenarios with imperfect CSIT. In this article, we depart from this conventional approach and introduce readers to a promising strategy based on rate-splitting. Rate-splitting relies on the transmission of common and private messages, and is shown to provide significant benefits in terms of spectral and energy efficiencies, reliability, and CSI feedback overhead reduction over conventional strategies used in LTE-A and exclusively relying on private message transmissions. Open problems, the impact on standard specifications, and operational challenges are also discussed.},

While simultaneous transmission of data and power, making optimal use of the scarce wireless spectrum, has been proposed before, it is also possible to consider dual-purpose hardware to decode data and harvest power from the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) waveform. In this paper we study the trade-off between power and data reception for an integrated receiver. It is shown that the hardware can behave as a rectifier or envelope detector, depending on the excitation's symbol rate and the rectifier's low pass filter's cut-off frequency.},

abstract = {We investigate the worst-case robust beamforming for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in a multiuser beamspace massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The objective is to minimize the transmit power of the base station subject to the individual signal-To-interference-plus-noise ratio and the energy-harvesting constraints under imperfect channel state information. Instead of directly resorting to semi-definite relaxation, we convert the initial non-convex optimization to a power allocation problem, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. The beamforming vectors are proven to be scaled versions of the estimated channels. The optimal scaling factors are then derived in closed-form. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed robust beamforming method achieves the globally optimal point for the initial design when the channel estimation errors are small while leads to satisfactory performance when the channel estimation errors are large.},

abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technique for future wireless communication networks. How to reliably transmit information in a RIS-based communication system arouses much interest. This paper proposes a reflecting modulation (RM) scheme for RIS-based communications, where both the reflecting patterns and transmit signals can carry information. Depending on that the transmitter and RIS jointly or independently deliver information, RM is further classified into two categories: jointly mapped RM (JRM) and separately mapped RM (SRM). JRM and SRM are naturally superior to existing schemes, because the transmit signal vectors, reflecting patterns, and bit mapping methods of JRM and SRM are more flexibly designed. To enhance transmission reliability, this paper proposes a discrete optimization-based joint signal mapping, shaping, and reflecting (DJMSR) design for JRM and SRM to minimize the bit error rate (BER) with a given transmit signal candidate set and a given reflecting pattern candidate set. To further improve the performance, this paper optimizes multiple reflecting patterns and their associated transmit signal sets in continuous fields for JRM and SRM. Numerical results show that JRM and SRM with the proposed system optimization methods considerably outperform existing schemes in BER.},

abstract = {Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) is subject to nonlinearity at the energy harvester that leads to significant changes to transmit signal designs compared to conventional wireless communications. In this paper, the capacity of a discrete time, memoryless and complex Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel in the presence of a nonlinear energy harvester at the receiver is studied. Considering the two common nonlinear energy harvester models introduced in the literature, two sets of constraints are considered. First the capacity is studied under average power (AP), peak amplitude (PA) and receiver delivery power (RDP) constraints. The RDP constraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under AP and RDP constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an AP constraint, however, depending on the two constraints, it can be either achieved or arbitrarily approached. It is also shown that under AP, PA and RDP constraints, the amplitude of the optimal inputs is discrete with a finite number of mass points. Next, the capacity is studied under AP, PA and output outage probability (OOP) constraints. OOP is modelled as satisfying a certain probability inequality for the amplitude of the received signal being outside of a given interval. Similarly, it is shown that the amplitude of the optimal input is discrete with a finite number of mass points.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting for wireless communication networks is a new paradigm that allows terminals to recharge their batteries from external energy sources in the surrounding environment. A promising energy harvesting technology is wireless power transfer where terminals harvest energy from electromagnetic radiation. Thereby, the energy may be harvested opportunistically from ambient electromagnetic sources or from sources that intentionally transmit electromagnetic energy for energy harvesting purposes. A particularly interesting and challenging scenario arises when sources perform simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), as strong signals not only increase power transfer but also interference. This article provides an overview of SWIPT systems with a particular focus on the hardware realization of rectenna circuits and practical techniques that achieve SWIPT in the domains of time, power, antennas, and space. The article also discusses the benefits of a potential integration of SWIPT technologies in modern communication networks in the context of resource allocation and cooperative cognitive radio networks.},

Prior works on IRS are mainly based on an ideal phase shift model with full reflection regardless of phase shift, which, however, is practically difficult to realize. In contrast, we propose in this letter a practical phase shift model that captures the phase dependent amplitude in the reflection coefficient. Applying this new model to an IRS-aided wireless system, we formulate a problem to maximize its achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the IRS reflect beamforming. The formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to be optimally solved in general, for which we propose a low-complexity suboptimal solution based on the alternating optimization (AO) technique. Simulation results unveil a substantial performance gain achieved by the joint beamforming optimization based on the proposed phase shift model as compared to the conventional ideal model.},

In the WET-MM system, the H-AP is equipped with a large number M of antennas and functions like a conventional AP in receiving data from users, but additionally supplies wireless power to the users. We consider frame-based transmissions. Each frame is divided into three phases: the uplink channel estimation (CE) phase, the downlink WET phase, as well as the uplink wireless information transmission (WIT) phase. Firstly, users use a fraction of the previously harvested energy to send pilots, while the H-AP estimates the uplink channels and obtains the downlink channels by exploiting channel reciprocity. Next, the H-AP utilizes the channel estimates just obtained to transfer wireless energy to all users in the downlink via energy beamforming. Finally, the users use a portion of the harvested energy to send data to the H-AP simultaneously in the uplink (reserving some harvested energy for sending pilots in the next frame). To optimize the throughput and ensure rate fairness, we consider the problem of maximizing the minimum rate among all users. In the large- M regime, we obtain the asymptotically optimal solutions and some interesting insights for the optimal design of WET-MM system.},

abstract = {This work focuses on the downlink of a single-cell multi-user system in which a base station (BS) equipped with {\$}M{\$} antennas communicates with {\$}K{\$} single-antenna users through a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) installed in the line-of-sight (LoS) of the BS. RIS is envisioned to offer unprecedented spectral efficiency gains by utilizing {\$}N{\$} passive reflecting elements that induce phase shifts on the impinging electromagnetic waves to smartly reconfigure the signal propagation environment. We study the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) achieved by the optimal linear precoder (OLP), that maximizes the minimum SINR subject to a given power constraint for any given RIS phase matrix, for the cases where the LoS channel matrix between the BS and the RIS is of rank-one and of full-rank. In the former scenario, the minimum SINR achieved by the RIS-assisted link is bounded by a quantity that goes to zero with {\$}K{\$}. For the high-rank scenario, we develop accurate deterministic approximations for the parameters of the asymptotically OLP, which are then utilized to optimize the RIS phase matrix. Simulation results show that RISs can outperform half-duplex relays with a small number of passive reflecting elements while large RISs are needed to outperform full-duplex relays.},

abstract = {The millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band has been utilized in the IEEE 802.11ad standard to achieve multi-Gbps throughput. Despite the advantages, mmWave links are highly vulnerable to both user and environmental mobility. Since mmWave radios use highly directional antennas, the line-of-sight (LOS) signal can be easily blocked by various obstacles, such as walls, furniture, and humans. In the complicated indoor environment, it is highly possible that the blocked mmWave link cannot be restored no matter how the access point and the mobile user change their antenna directions. To address the problem and enable indoor mobile mmWave networks, in this paper, we introduce the reconfigurable 60 GHz reflect-arrays to establish robust mmWave connections for indoor networks even when the links are blocked by obstructions. First, the reconfigurable 60 GHz reflect-array is designed, implemented, and modeled. Then a three-party beam-searching protocol is designed for reflect-array-assisted 802.11ad networks. Finally, an optimal array deployment strategy is developed to minimize the link outage probability in indoor mobile mmWave networks. The proposed solution is validated and evaluated by both in-lab experiments and computer simulations.},

It summarizes the operating principles of a range of wireless power research into 1) the maximum power transfer and 2) the maximum energy efficiency principles. The differences and the implications of these two approaches are explained in terms of their energy efficiency and transmission distance capabilities. The differences between the system energy efficiency and the transmission efficiency are also highlighted. The review covers the two-coil systems, the four-coil systems, the systems with relay resonators and the wireless domino-resonator systems. Related issues including human exposure issues and reduction of winding resistance are also addressed. The review suggests that the use of the maximum energy efficiency principle in the two-coil systems is suitable for short-range rather than mid-range applications, the use of the maximum power transfer principle in the four-coil systems is good for maximizing the transmission distance, but is under a restricted system energy efficiency ({\textless}50{\%}); the use of the maximum energy efficiency principle in relay or domino systems may offer a good compromise for good system energy efficiency and transmission distance on the condition that relay resonators can be placed between the power source and the load. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Among various enabling technologies for UAVs, wireless communication is essential and has drawn significantly growing attention in recent years. Compared to the conventional terrestrial communications, UAVs' communications face new challenges due to their high altitude above the ground and great flexibility of movement in the 3-D space. Several critical issues arise, including the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant UAV-ground channels and induced strong aerial-terrestrial network interference, the distinct communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for UAV control messages versus payload data, the stringent constraints imposed by the size, weight, and power (SWAP) limitations of UAVs, as well as the exploitation of the new design degree of freedom (DoF) brought by the highly controllable 3-D UAV mobility. In this article, we give a tutorial overview of the recent advances in UAV communications to address the above issues, with an emphasis on how to integrate UAVs into the forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) and future cellular networks. In particular, we partition our discussion into two promising research and application frameworks of UAV communications, namely UAV-assisted wireless communications and cellular-connected UAVs, where UAVs are integrated into the network as new aerial communication platforms and users, respectively. Furthermore, we point out promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {In a multi-user multi-antenna Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) network, the transmitter sends information to the Information Receivers (IRs) and energy to Energy Receivers (ERs) concurrently. A conventional approach is based on Multi-User Linear Precoding (MU-LP) where each IR directly decodes the intended stream by fully treating the interference from other IRs and ERs as noise. In this paper, we investigate the application of linearly-precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) in Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) SWIPT Broadcast Channel (BC). By splitting the messages of IRs into private and common parts and encoding the common parts into a common stream decoded by all IRs, RS manages the interference dynamically. The precoders are designed such that the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) of IRs is maximized under the total transmit power constraint and the sum energy constraint for ERs. Numerical results show that the proposed RS-assisted strategy provides a better rate-energy tradeoff in MISO SWIPT BC. Under a sum energy constraint of ERs, RS-assisted strategy achieves better WSR performance of IRs than MU-LP and NOMA in a wide range of IR and ER deployments. Hence, we draw the conclusion that RS is superior for downlink SWIPT networks.},

It has been illustrated that for the synchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) scenario, the so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm can accurately and efficiently approximate multiuser MLD. This SDR-MLD algorithm, however, can only handle binary and quadratic phase shift keying (PSK) symbol constellations. In this sequel, we propose an extended SDR algorithm for MLD with M-ary PSK (MPSK) constellations. For the synchronous CDMA scenario, the proposed SDR algorithm provides an attractive polynomial-time complexity order of K3.5, where K is the number of users. Simulation results indicate that the proposed detector provides improved symbol error performance compared with several commonly used multiuser detectors. {\textcopyright} 2004, IEEE.

abstract = {Space-division multiple access (SDMA) utilizes linear precoding to separate users in the spatial domain and relies on fully treating any residual multi-user interference as noise. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) uses linearly precoded superposition coding with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to superpose users in the power domain and relies on user grouping and ordering to enforce some users to fully decode and cancel interference created by other users. In this paper, we argue that to efficiently cope with the high throughput, heterogeneity of quality of service (QoS), and massive connectivity requirements of future multi-antenna wireless networks, multiple access design needs to depart from those two extreme interference management strategies, namely fully treat interference as noise (as in SDMA) and fully decode interference (as in NOMA). Considering a multiple-input single-output broadcast channel, we develop a novel multiple access framework, called rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA is a more general and more powerful multiple access for downlink multi-antenna systems that contains SDMA and NOMA as special cases. RSMA relies on linearly precoded rate-splitting with SIC to decode part of the interference and treat the remaining part of the interference as noise. This capability of RSMA to partially decode interference and partially treat interference as noise enables to softly bridge the two extremes of fully decoding interference and treating interference as noise and provides room for rate and QoS enhancements and complexity reduction. The three multiple access schemes are compared, and extensive numerical results show that RSMA provides a smooth transition between SDMA and NOMA and outperforms them both in a wide range of network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions, channel strengths, and qualities of channel state information at the transmitter). Moreover, RSMA provides rate and QoS enhancements over NOMA at a lower computational complexity for the transmit scheduler and the receivers (number of SIC layers).},

Moreover, their effect on the communication quality is intractable in all but the simplest cases. The present work proposes a new paradigm, where indoor scattering becomes software-defined and, subsequently, optimizable across wide frequency ranges. Moreover, the controlled scattering can surpass natural behavior, exemplary overriding Snell's law, reflecting waves towards any custom angle (including negative ones). Thus, path loss and multi-path fading effects can be controlled and mitigated. The core technology of this new paradigm are metasurfaces, planar artificial structures whose effect on impinging electromagnetic waves is fully defined by their macro-structure. The present study contributes the software-programmable wireless environment model, consisting of several HyperSurface tiles controlled by a central, environment configuration server. HyperSurfaces are a novel class of metasurfaces whose structure and, hence, electromagnetic behavior can be altered and controlled via a software interface. Multiple networked tiles coat indoor objects, allowing fine-grained, customizable reflection, absorption or polarization overall. A central server calculates and deploys the optimal electromagnetic interaction per tile, to the benefit of communicating devices. Realistic simulations using full 3D ray-tracing demonstrate the groundbreaking potential of the proposed approach in 2.4GHz and 60GHz frequencies.},

abstract = {This paper studies the coordinated beamforming design problem for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel, assuming only channel distribution information (CDI) known to the transmitters. Under a given requirement on the rate outage probability for receivers, we aim to maximize the system utility (e.g., the weighted sum rate, weighted geometric mean rate, and the weighed harmonic mean rate) subject to the rate outage constraints and individual power constraints. The outage constraints, however, lead to a complicated, nonconvex structure for the considered beamforming design problem and render the optimization problem difficult to handle. Although this nonconvex optimization problem can be solved in an exhaustive search manner, this brute-force approach is only feasible when the number of transmitter-receiver pairs is small. For a system with a large number of transmitter-receiver pairs, computationally efficient alternatives are necessary. Hence, the focus of this paper is the design of such efficient approximation methods. In particular, by employing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and first-order approximation techniques, we propose an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality approximate beamforming solutions via solving a sequence of convex approximation problems. The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a stationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming design problem. Furthermore, we propose a distributed SCA algorithm where each transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using local CDI and information obtained from limited message exchange with the other transmitters. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its distributed counterpart indeed converge, and promising performance can be achieved for all the considered system utilities. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper considers transmit optimization in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channels, wherein we aim at maximizing the secrecy capacity or rate of an MIMO channel overheard by one or multiple eavesdroppers. Such optimization problems are nonconvex, and appear to be difficult especially in the multi-eavesdropper scenario. In this paper, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) approach to tackle these secrecy optimization problems. We first consider the secrecy capacity maximization (SCM) problem in the single eavesdropper scenario. An AO algorithm is derived through a judicious SCM reformulation. The algorithm conducts some kind of reweighting and water-filling in an alternating fashion, and thus is computationally efficient to implement. We also prove that the AO algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the SCM problem. Then, we turn our attention to the multiple eavesdropper scenario, where the artificial noise (AN)-aided secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is considered. Although the AN-aided SRM problem has a more complex problem structure than the previous SCM, we show that AO can be extended to deal with the former, wherein the problem is handled by solving convex problems in an alternating fashion. Again, the resulting AO method is proven to have KKT point convergence guarantee. For fast implementation, a custom-designed AO algorithm based on smoothing and projected gradient is also derived. The secrecy rate performance and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by simulations. {\textcopyright} 1983-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {We study the effect of channel fading in wireless power transfer (WPT) and show that fading enhances the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of nonlinear RF energy harvesters. We then develop a new form of signal design for WPT, denoted as transmit diversity, that relies on multiple dumb antennas at the transmitter to induce fast fluctuations of the wireless channel. Those fluctuations boost the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency thanks to the energy harvester nonlinearity. In contrast with (energy) beamforming, transmit diversity does not rely on channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and does not increase the average power at the energy harvester input, even though it still enhances the overall end-to-end power transfer efficiency. Transmit diversity is also combined with recently developed (energy) waveform and modulation to provide further enhancements. The efficacy of the scheme is analyzed using physics-based and curve fitting-based nonlinear models of the energy harvester and demonstrated using circuit simulations, prototyping and experimentation. Measurements with two transmit antennas reveal gains of 50{\%} in harvested DC power over a single transmit antenna setup. The work (again) highlights the crucial role played by the harvester nonlinearity and demonstrates that multiple transmit antennas can be beneficial to WPT even in the absence of CSIT.},

We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power transferred to all EH receivers subject to given minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at different ID receivers. In particular, we consider two types of ID receivers (referred to as Type I and Type II, respectively) without or with the capability of cancelling the interference from (a priori known) energy signals. For each type of ID receivers, we formulate the joint information and energy transmit beamforming design as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). First, we obtain the globally optimal solutions for our formulated QCQPs by applying an optimization technique so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). It is shown via SDR that under the condition of independently distributed user channels, no dedicated energy beam is used for the case of Type I ID receivers to achieve the optimal solution; while for the case of Type II ID receivers, employing no more than one energy beam is optimal. Next, we establish a new form of the celebrated uplink-downlink duality for our studied downlink beamforming problems, and thereby develop alternative algorithms to obtain the same optimal solutions as by SDR. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of proposed optimal beamforming designs for MISO SWIPT systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Previous studies have confirmed the adverse impact of fading correlation on the mutual information (MI) of two-dimensional (2D) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. More recently, the trend is to enhance the system performance by exploiting the channels degrees of freedom in the elevation, which necessitates the derivation and characterization of three-dimensional (3D) channels in the presence of spatial correlation. In this paper, an exact closed-form expression for the Spatial Correlation Function (SCF) is derived for 3D MIMO channels. The proposed method resorts to the spherical harmonic expansion (SHE) of plane waves and the trigonometric expansion of Legendre and associated Legendre polynomials. The resulting expression depends on the underlying arbitrary angular distributions and antenna patterns through the Fourier Series (FS) coefficients of power azimuth and elevation spectrums. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the SCF being valid for any 3D propagation environment. The developed SCF determines the covariance matrices at the transmitter and the receiver that form the Kronecker channel model. In order to quantify the effects of correlation on system performance, the information-theoretic deterministic equivalents of the MI for the Kronecker model are utilized in both mono-user and multi-user cases. Numerical results validate the proposed analytical expressions and elucidate the dependence of the system performance on azimuth and elevation angular spreads and antenna patterns. Some useful insights into the behavior of MI as a function of downtilt angles are provided. The derived model will help evaluate the performance of correlated 3D MIMO channels in the future.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technique to enhance the wireless communication spectral efficiency with low hardware and energy cost. In this letter, we consider the integration of IRS to an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiuser downlink communication system, and study the pertinent joint optimization of the IRS reflection coefficients and OFDMA time-frequency resource block as well as power allocations to maximize the users' common (minimum) rate. Specifically, due to the lack of frequency-selective passive beamforming capability at the IRS, only one set of reflection coefficients can be designed for adapting to a large number of channels of multiple users over different frequency sub-bands. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS reflection coefficients are dynamically adjusted over different time slots within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying channels and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time slot, thus achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system common rate over the setup without IRS and that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic passive beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a common set of reflection coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more flexibly balancing between passive beamforming and multiuser diversity gains.},

The MIMO SWIPT design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem in which system sum rate is optimized considering per-user harvesting constraints. Two different approaches are proposed. The first approach is based on a classical gradient-based method for constrained optimization. The second approach is based on difference of convex (DC) programming. The idea behind this approach is to obtain a convex function that approximates the nonconvex objective and, then, solve a series of convex subproblems that, eventually, will provide a (locally) optimum solution of the general nonconvex problem. The solution obtained from the proposed approach is compared to the classical block-diagonalization (BD) strategy, typically used to solve the nonconvex multiuser MIMO network by forcing no inter-user interference. Simulation results show that the proposed approach improves both the system sum rate and the power harvested by users simultaneously. In terms of computational time, the proposed DC programming outperforms the classical gradient methods.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has drawn a lot of attention recently as a promising new solution to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless communication systems. By utilizing massive low-cost passive reflecting elements, the wireless propagation environment becomes controllable and thus can be made favorable for improving the communication performance. Prior works on IRS mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), which, however, is practically difficult to obtain for IRS-associated links due to its passive operation and large number of elements. To overcome this difficulty, we propose in this paper a new two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol to maximize the achievable average sum-rate for an IRS-aided multiuser system under the general correlated Rician channel model. Specifically, the passive IRS phase-shifts are first optimized based on the statistical CSI (S-CSI) of all links, which varies much slowly as compared to their I-CSI, while the transmit beamforming/precoding vectors at the access point (AP) are then designed to cater to the I-CSI of the users' effective channels with the optimized IRS phase-shifts, thus significantly reducing the channel training overhead and passive beamforming complexity over the existing schemes based on the I-CSI of all channels. For the single-user case, a novel penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed, where the IRS phase-shifts are updated in parallel to reduce the computational time. For the multiuser case, we propose a general TTS optimization algorithm by constructing a quadratic surrogate of the objective function, which cannot be explicitly expressed in closed-form. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and evaluate the impact of S-CSI and channel correlation on the system performance.},

abstract = {The capacity of a complex and discrete time memoryless Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel under three constraints, namely, input average power, input amplitude and delivered power at the output is studied. The delivered power constraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under transmit average power and receiver delivered power constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an average power constraint, however, depending on the two constraints, it can be either achieved (via Circular Symmetric Complex Gaussian (CSCG) input) or arbitrarily approached (via time sharing between inputs with high amount of information, e.g. CSCG, and inputs with high amount of power, exhibiting a low probability of high amplitude signals). As an application, a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated nonlinear model of the harvester is used. It is shown that the delivered power depends on higher order statistics of the channel input. Two inner bounds, one based on complex Gaussian inputs and the other based on convexifying the optimization probability space, are obtained for the Rate-Power (RP) region. For Gaussian inputs, the optimal inputs are zero mean and a tradeoff between information and power is recognized by considering asymmetric power allocations between Inphase and Quadrature subchannels. Through numerical algorithms, it is observed that the numerically obtained input (NOI) distributions attain larger RP region compared to Gaussian input counterparts. The benefits of the newly developed and optimized input distributions are also confirmed and validated through realistic circuit simulations.},

abstract = {Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is expected to be a technology reshaping the landscape of low-power applications such as the Internet of Things. Multi-antenna multi-sine waveforms adaptive to the channel state information have been shown to be a promising building block of WPT. However, the current design is computationally too complex to be applied to large-scale WPT, where signals are sent across a large number (tens) of antennas and frequencies. This paper proposes efficient single/multi-user algorithms based on a generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit waveforms that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity of the rectenna on the design of waveforms in single/multi-user systems. Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial beamforming, obtained before optimizing power allocation across frequencies, turns out to be maximum ratio transmission. Nevertheless, in the general multi-user weighted-sum criterion maximization problem, optimizations in the frequency and the spatial domains are coupled. Assuming channel hardening, we also propose low-complexity algorithms based on asymptotic analysis, where the structure of the asymptotically optimal spatial beamforming can be found before optimizations. Simulation results confirm the inefficiency of the linear model-based design in single/multi-user systems. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed algorithms (based on the nonlinear model) can benefit from an increasing number of sinewaves at a computational cost much lower than the existing method. Simulation results also indicate that the large-scale WPT architecture can boost the end-to-end power transfer efficiency and the transmission range.},

We first derive the achievable rates for the primary system and the BD transmission.

In addition, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the solutions. Simulation results show that when the BD transmission rate is properly designed, the proposed SR not only enables the opportunistic transmission for the BD via energy-efficient passive backscattering, but also enhances the achievable rate of the primary system by properly exploiting the additional signal path from the BD.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and revolutionizing technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless networks. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF) signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve high passive beamforming gains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency of RF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in the paper an IRS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Specifically, a set of IRSs are deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), respectively. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP via jointly optimizing its transmit precoders and the reflect phase shifts at all IRSs, subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints at all users, namely, the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at IUs and energy harvesting constraints at EUs. However, this optimization problem is non-convex with intricately coupled variables, for which the existing alternating optimization approach is shown to be inefficient as the number of QoS constraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper transformations on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the penalty-based method. Moreover, by exploiting the short-range coverage of IRSs, we further propose a low-complexity algorithm by optimizing the phase shifts of all IRSs in parallel.},

In order to improve the sensitivity, the antenna-rectifier interface is analyzed as it plays a crucial role in the co-design optimization. Subsequently, a 5-stage cross-connected differential rectifier with a 7-bit binary-weighted capacitor bank is designed and fabricated in standard 90 nm CMOS technology. The rectifier is brought at resonance with a high-Q loop antenna by means of a control loop that compensates for any variation at the antenna-rectifier interface and passively boosts the antenna voltage to enhance the sensitivity. A complementary MOS diode is proposed to improve the harvester's ability to store and hold energy over a long period of time during which there is insufficient power for rectification.

We analyze the convergence rate of the method and establish a nonasymptotic sublinear rate of convergence where the multiplicative constant depends on the minimal block Lipschitz constant. We then analyze the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method for solving convex problems involving sums of norms. Based on the results derived for the AM method, we establish a nonasymptotic sublinear rate of convergence of the IRLS method. In addition, we show an asymptotic rate of convergence whose efficiency estimate does not depend on the data of the problem.

abstract = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising new solution to provide convenient and perpetual energy supplies to wireless networks. In practice, WPT is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic resonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for short-/mid-/long- range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider the EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry energy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system consisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common transmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from the transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the transmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information rate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we show an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to decode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two practical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and power splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to the outer bound. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper considers orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We study the resource allocation algorithm design for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bits/Joule delivered to the receivers). In particular, we focus on power splitting hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting. Two scenarios are investigated considering different power splitting abilities of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can split the received power into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary power splitting ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can split the received power only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed power splitting ratios. For both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm design as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. By exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the non-convex problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and wireless power transfer: (1) wireless power transfer enhances the system energy efficiency by harvesting energy in the radio frequency, especially in the interference limited regime; (2) the presence of multiple receivers is beneficial for the system capacity, but not necessarily for the system energy efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The idea of wireless power transfer (WPT) has been around since the inception of electricity. In the late 19th century, Nikola Tesla described the freedom to transfer energy between two points without the need for a physical connection to a power source as an ?all-surpassing importance to man? [1]. A truly wireless device, capable of being remotely powered, not only allows the obvious freedom of movement but also enables devices to be more compact by removing the necessity of a large battery. Applications could leverage this reduction in size and weight to increase the feasibility of concepts such as paper-thin, flexible displays [2], contact-lens-based augmented reality [3], and smart dust [4], among traditional point-to-point power transfer applications. While several methods of wireless power have been introduced since Tesla?s work, including near-field magnetic resonance and inductive coupling, laser-based optical power transmission, and far-field RF/microwave energy transmission, only RF/microwave and laser-based systems are truly long-range methods. While optical power transmission certainly has merit, its mechanisms are outside of the scope of this article and will not be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

In this scenario, it is assumed that some users are able to harvest power from radio frequency (RF) signals to recharge batteries through wireless power transfer from the transmitter, while others are served simultaneously with data transmission. The criterion driving the optimization and design of the system is based on the weighted sum rate for the users being served with data. At the same time, constraints stating minimum per-user harvested powers are included in the optimization problem. This paper derives the structure of the optimal transmit covariance matrices in the case where both types of users are present simultaneously in the network, particularizing the results to the cases where either only harvesting nodes or only information users are to be served. The trade-off between the achieved weighted sum rate and the powers harvested by the user terminals is analyzed and evaluated using the rate-power (R-P) region. Finally, we propose a two-stage user grouping mechanism that decides which users should be scheduled to receive information and which users should be configured to harvest energy from the RF signals in each particular scheduling period, this being one of the main contributions of this paper.},

The problem of modulation design for SWIPT has however been scarcely addressed. In this paper, a modulation scheme based on asymmetric phase-shift keying (PSK) is considered, which improves the SWIPT rate-energy trade-off region significantly. The nonlinear rectifier model, which accurately models the energy harvester, is adopted for evaluating the output direct current (DC) power at the receiver. The harvested DC power is maximized under an average power constraint at the transmitter and a constraint on the rate of information transmitted via a multi-carrier signal over a flat fading channel. As a consequence of the rectifier nonlinearity, this work highlights that asymmetric PSK modulation provides benefits over conventional symmetric PSK modulation in SWIPT and opens the door to systematic modulation design tailored for SWIPT.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new technology for achieving both spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication systems in the future. However, existing works on IRS mainly consider frequency-flat channels and assume perfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Motivated by this, in this paper we study an IRS-enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective channels and propose a practical transmission protocol with channel estimation. First, to reduce the overhead in channel training and estimation and to exploit the channel spatial correlation, we propose a novel IRS elements grouping method, where each group consists of a set of adjacent IRS elements that share a common reflection coefficient. Based on this grouping method, we propose a practical transmission protocol where only the combined channel of each group needs to be estimated, thus substantially reducing the training overhead. Next, with any given grouping and estimated CSI, we formulate the problem to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation and the IRS passive array reflection coefficients. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by alternately optimizing the power allocation and the passive array coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the initialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the case without using IRS. Moreover, it is shown that there exists an optimal size for IRS elements grouping which achieves the maximum achievable rate due to the trade-off between the training overhead and IRS passive beamforming flexibility.},

By adjusting the reflection coefficients, the IRS can change the phase shifts on the impinging electromagnetic waves so that it can smartly reconfigure the signal propagation environment and enhance the power of the desired received signal or suppress the interference signal. In this paper, we consider downlink multigroup multicast communication systems assisted by an IRS. We aim for maximizing the sum rate of all the multicasting groups by the joint optimization of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the reflection coefficients at the IRS under both the power and unit-modulus constraint. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose two efficient algorithms under the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm framework. Specifically, a concave lower bound surrogate objective function of each user's rate has been derived firstly, based on which two sets of variables can be updated alternately by solving two corresponding second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems. Then, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we derive another concave lower bound function of each group's rate for each set of variables at every iteration, and obtain the closed-form solutions under these loose surrogate objective functions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the benefits in terms of the spectral and energy efficiency of the introduced IRS and the effectiveness in terms of the convergence and complexity of our proposed algorithms.},

It has been found that signals featuring a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) can provide efficiency improvement when compared with CW signals. A number of approaches have been proposed, such as multisines/multicarrier orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) signals, chaotic signals, harmonicsignals, ultrawideband (UWB) signals, intermittent CW (ICW) signals, or white-noise signals. This article reviews these techniques with a focus on multisines/multicarrier signals, harmonic signals, and chaotic signals. A theoretical explanation for efficiency improvement is provided and accompanied by experimental results. Circuit design considerations are presented for the receiver side, and efficient transmission architectures are also described with an emphasis on spatial power combining.},

The choice of the load can be tricky, showing an advantage of a certain type of signals over another. For low RF power (-17dBm), the multitone signals do not improve the peak RF-to-dc power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the continuous wave (CW) single-tone signal, if the optimal load is selected for each case, however, the multitone signals maintain that peak PCE of ∼ 47{\%} over higher output voltage (i.e: larger loads), and consequently enable more efficient dc-to-dc voltage boosting or even eliminate the need for the voltage booster in the RF power receiver. Thus, the low-power multitone waveforms can be considered as a voltage sensitivity booster rather than a PCE efficiency booster. This boosted rectified voltage is the key advantage of the multitone signals that leads to the enhancement in the overall efficiency of the low-RF power receiver.},

Although radiative WPT shares many similar characteristics with the extensively studied wireless information transfer or communication, they also differ significantly in terms of design objectives, transmitter/receiver architectures and hardware constraints, and so on. In this paper, we first give an overview on the various WPT technologies, the historical development of the radiative WPT technology and the main challenges in designing contemporary radiative WPT systems. Then, we focus on the state-of-the-art communication and signal processing techniques that can be applied to tackle these challenges. Topics discussed include energy harvester modeling, energy beamforming for WPT, channel acquisition, power region characterization in multi-user WPT, waveform design with linear and non-linear energy receiver model, safety and health issues of WPT, massive multiple-input multiple-output and millimeter wave enabled WPT, wireless charging control, and wireless power and communication systems co-design. We also point out directions that are promising for future research.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have received considerable attention from the wireless communications research community recently. In particular, as low-cost passive devices, IRSs enable the control of the wireless propagation environment, which is not possible in conventional wireless networks. To take full advantage of such IRS-assisted communication systems, both the beamformer at the access point (AP) and the phase shifts at the IRS need to be optimally designed. However, thus far, the optimal design is not well understood. In this paper, a point-to-point IRS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system is investigated. The beamformer at the AP and the IRS phase shifts are jointly optimized to maximize the spectral efficiency. Two efficient algorithms exploiting fixed point iteration and manifold optimization techniques, respectively, are developed for solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem. The proposed algorithms not only achieve a higher spectral efficiency but also lead to a lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art approach. Simulation results reveal that deploying large-scale IRSs in wireless systems is more efficient than increasing the antenna array size at the AP for enhancing both the spectral and the energy efficiency.},

abstract = {Consider a downlink communication system where multiantenna base stations transmit independent data streams to decentralized single-antenna users over a common frequency band. The goal of the base stations is to jointly adjust the beamforming vectors to minimize the transmission powers while ensuring the signal-to-interference-noise ratio requirement of each user within the system. At the same time, it may be necessary to keep the interference generated on other coexisting systems under a certain tolerable level. In addition, one may want to include general individual shaping constraints on the beamforming vectors. This beamforming problem is a separable homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic program, and it is difficult to solve in general. In this paper, we give conditions under which strong duality holds and propose efficient algorithms for the optimal beamforming problem. First, we study rank-constrained solutions of general separable semidefinite programs (SDPs) and propose rank reduction procedures to achieve a lower rank solution. Then we show that the SDP relaxation of three classes of optimal beamforming problem always has a rank-one solution, which can be obtained by invoking the rank reduction procedures.

abstract = {Fractional programming (FP) refers to a family of optimization problems that involve ratio term(s). This two-part paper explores the use of FP in the design and optimization of communication systems. Part I of this paper focuses on FP theory and on solving continuous problems. The main theoretical contribution is a novel quadratic transform technique for tackling the multiple-ratio concave-convex FP problem - in contrast to conventional FP techniques that mostly can only deal with the single-ratio or the max-min-ratio case. Multiple-ratio FP problems are important for the optimization of communication networks, because system-level design often involves multiple signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio terms. This paper considers the applications of FP to solving continuous problems in communication system design, particularly for power control, beamforming, and energy efficiency maximization. These application cases illustrate that the proposed quadratic transform can greatly facilitate the optimization involving ratios by recasting the original nonconvex problem as a sequence of convex problems. This FP-based problem reformulation gives rise to an efficient iterative optimization algorithm with provable convergence to a stationary point. The paper further demonstrates close connections between the proposed FP approach and other well-known algorithms in the literature, such as the fixed-point iteration and the weighted minimum mean-square-error beamforming. The optimization of discrete problems is discussed in Part II of this paper.},

abstract = {Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has attracted significant attention in recent years. Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research community in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the design of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect of transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform so as to enhance the dc power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a tractable model of the nonlinearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear model conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design novel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information (CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission with all the power allocated to a single frequency, the nonlinear model favours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic simulations, waveforms designed based on the nonlinear model are shown to provide significant gains (in terms of harvested dc power) over those designed based on the linear model and over nonadaptive waveforms. We also compute analytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various waveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those scaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT and of a WPT design based on a nonlinear rectenna model over a linear model. Results also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on large-scale multisine multiantenna waveforms for WPT. As a final note, results stress the importance of modeling and accounting for the nonlinearity of the rectenna in any system design involving wireless power.},

In existing massive MIMO systems, however, conventional phased arrays are used for beamforming. This method results in excessive power consumption and high hardware costs. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the revolutionary technologies to enable energy-efficient and smart wireless communications, which is a two-dimensional structure with a large number of passive elements. In this paper, we develop a new type of high-gain yet low-cost RIS that bears 256 elements. The proposed RIS combines the functions of phase shift and radiation together on an electromagnetic surface, where positive intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are used to realize 2-bit phase shifting for beamforming. This radical design forms the basis for the world's first wireless communication prototype using RIS having 256 two-bit elements. The prototype consists of modular hardware and flexible software that encompass the following: the hosts for parameter setting and data exchange, the universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for baseband and radio frequency (RF) signal processing, as well as the RIS for signal transmission and reception. Our performance evaluation confirms the feasibility and efficiency of RISs in wireless communications. We show that, at 2.3 GHz, the proposed RIS can achieve a 21.7 dBi antenna gain. At the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, that is, 28.5 GHz, it attains a 19.1 dBi antenna gain. Furthermore, it has been shown that the RIS-based wireless communication prototype developed is capable of significantly reducing the power consumption.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and revolutionizing technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless networks. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF) signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve high passive beamforming gains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency of RF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in this paper an IRS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Specifically, a set of IRSs are deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), respectively. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP via jointly optimizing its transmit precoders and the reflect phase shifts at all IRSs, subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints at all users, namely, the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at IUs and the energy harvesting constraints at EUs. However, this optimization problem is non-convex with intricately coupled variables, for which the existing alternating optimization approach is shown to be inefficient as the number of QoS constraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper transformations on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the penalty-based optimization method. Moreover, by exploiting the short-range coverage of IRS, we further propose a more computationally efficient algorithm by optimizing the phase shifts at all IRSs in parallel. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of employing multiple IRSs for enhancing the performance of SWIPT systems as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed algorithms over benchmark schemes. The impact of IRS on the transmitter/receiver design for SWIPT is also unveiled.},

Two main benefits are adaptive beamforming gains and spatial multiplexing, leading to high data rates per user and per cell, especially when large antenna arrays are adopted.

Radically new approaches are required to achieve orders-of-magnitude improvements in these metrics. There will be large technical challenges, many of which are yet to be identified. In this paper, we survey three new multiple antenna technologies that can play key roles in beyond 5G networks: cell-free massive MIMO, beamspace massive MIMO, and intelligent reflecting surfaces. For each of these technologies, we present the fundamental motivation, key characteristics, recent technical progresses, and provide our perspectives for future research directions.

abstract = {Waveform design is a key technique to jointly exploit a beamforming gain, the channel frequency selectivity, and the rectifier nonlinearity, so as to enhance the end-to-end power transfer efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT). Those waveforms have been designed, assuming perfect channel state information at the transmitter. This paper proposes two waveform strategies relying on limited feedback for multi-antenna multi-sine WPT over frequency-selective channels. In the waveform selection strategy, the energy transmitter (ET) transmits over multiple timeslots with every time a different waveform precoder within a codebook, and the energy receiver (ER) reports the index of the precoder in the codebook that leads to the largest harvested energy. In the waveform refinement strategy, the ET sequentially transmits two waveforms in each stage, and the ER reports one feedback bit indicating an increase/decrease in the harvested energy during this stage. Based on multiple one-bit feedback, the ET successively refines waveform precoders in a tree-structured codebook over multiple stages. By employing the framework of the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, novel algorithms are proposed for both strategies to optimize the codebooks in both space and frequency domains. The proposed limited feedback-based waveform strategies are shown to outperform a set of baselines, achieving higher harvested energy.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying co-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the unintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We further assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or harvest energy at any time due to the practical circuit limitation. Therefore, it is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two modes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the instantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we determine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited information transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited information transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the receiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called "outage-energy" region and "rate-energy" region, respectively. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmit power control, information and energy transfer scheduling, and the receiver's mode switching. The effects of circuit energy consumption at the receiver on the achievable rate-energy trade-offs are also characterized. Our results provide useful guidelines for the efficient design of emerging wireless communication systems powered by opportunistic WEH. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

We show that in the high Signal-toInterference Ratios (SIR) regime, these nonlinear and apparently difficult, nonconvex optimization problems can be transformed into convex optimization problems in the form of geometric programming; hence they can be very efficiently solved for global optimality even with a large number of users. In the medium to low SIR regime, some of these constrained nonlinear optimization of power control cannot be turned into tractable convex formulations, but a heuristic can be used to compute in most cases the optimal solution by solving a series of geometric programs through the approach of successive convex approximation. While efficient and robust algorithms have been extensively studied for centralized solutions of geometric programs, distributed algorithms have not been explored before. We present a systematic method of distributed algorithms for power control that is geometric- programming-based.

Specifically, an IRS-assisted SWIPT system is considered, where a multi-antenna aided base station (BS) communicates with several multi-antenna assisted information receivers (IRs), while guaranteeing the energy harvesting requirement of the energy receivers (ERs). To maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of IRs, the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices of the BS and passive phase shift matrix of the IRS should be jointly optimized. To tackle this challenging optimization problem, we first adopt the classic block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for decoupling the original optimization problem into several subproblems and alternatively optimize the TPC matrices and the phase shift matrix. For each subproblem, we provide a low-complexity iterative algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of each subproblem. The BCD algorithm is rigorously proved to converge to the KKT point of the original problem. We also conceive a feasibility checking method to study its feasibility. Our extensive simulation results confirm that employing IRSs in SWIPT beneficially enhances the system performance and the proposed BCD algorithm converges rapidly, which is appealing for practical applications.},

The algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for the maximization of the total harvested power at energy harvesting receivers subject to minimumrequired signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at multiple information receivers. We transform the considered non-convex objective function from sum-of-ratios form into an equivalent objective function in subtractive form, which enables the derivation of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm.

abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation time of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter. We first consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel condition that is assumed to be known at the receiver. We derive the optimal power splitting rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between the maximum ergodic capacity for information transfer and the maximum average harvested energy for power transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called «rate-energy (R-E)» region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information is also known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmitter power control and receiver power splitting. The achievable R-E region by the proposed DPS scheme is also compared against that by the existing time switching scheme as well as a performance upper bound by ignoring the practical receiver constraint. Finally, we extend the result for optimal DPS to the SIMO (single-input multiple-output) system where the receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. In particular, we investigate a low-complexity power splitting scheme, namely antenna switching, which achieves the near-optimal rate-energy trade-offs as compared to the optimal DPS. {\textcopyright} 1972-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {A geometric program (GP) is a type of mathematical optimization problem characterized by objective and constraint functions that have a special form. Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale GPs extremely efficiently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit design, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) GPs. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in GP modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an engineering analysis or design problem, in GP format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation. This tutorial paper collects together in one place the basic background material needed to do GP modeling. We start with the basic definitions and facts, and some methods used to transform problems into GP format. We show how to recognize functions and problems compatible with GP, and how to approximate functions or data in a form compatible with GP (when this is possible). We give some simple and representative examples, and also describe some common extensions of GP, along with methods for solving (or approximately solving) them. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

In this paper, we investigate for the first time the JWIET in K-user MIMO IFC, in which receivers either decode the incoming information data (information decoding, ID) or harvest the RF energy (energy harvesting, EH). In the K-user IFC, we consider three different scenarios according to the receiver mode: i) multiple EH receivers and a single ID receiver, ii) multiple IDs and a single EH, and iii) multiple IDs and multiple EHs. For all scenarios, we have found a common necessary condition of the optimal transmission strategy and, accordingly, developed the transmission strategy that satisfies the common necessary condition, in which all the transmitters transferring energy exploit a rank-one energy beamforming. Furthermore, we have also proposed an iterative algorithm to optimize the covariance matrices of the transmitters that transfer information and the powers of the energy beamforming transmitters simultaneously, and identified the corresponding achievable rate-energy tradeoff region. Finally, we have shown that by selecting EH receivers according to their signal-to-leakage-and-harvested energy-ratio (SLER), we can improve the achievable rate-energy region further.},

abstract = {Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is expected to be a technology reshaping the landscape of low-power applications such as the Internet of Things. Multi-antenna multi-sine waveforms adaptive to the channel state information have been shown to be a promising building block of WPT. However, the current design is computationally too complex to be applied to large-scale WPT, where signals are sent across a large number (tens) of antennas and frequencies. This paper proposes efficient single/multi-user algorithms based on a generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit waveforms that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity of the rectenna on the design of waveforms in single/multi-user systems. Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial beamforming, obtained before optimizing power allocation across frequencies, turns out to be maximum ratio transmission. Nevertheless, in the general multi-user weighted-sum criterion maximization problem, optimizations in the frequency and the spatial domains are coupled. Assuming channel hardening, we also propose low-complexity algorithms based on asymptotic analysis, where the structure of the asymptotically optimal spatial beamforming can be found before optimizations. Simulation results confirm the inefficiency of the linear model-based design in single/multi-user systems. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed algorithms (based on the nonlinear model) can benefit from an increasing number of sinewaves at a computational cost much lower than the existing method. Simulation results also indicate that the large-scale WPT architecture can boost the end-to-end power transfer efficiency and the transmission range.},

The primary transmitter (PT) with multiple antennas is designed to broadcast common messages to the primary receiver (PR) and the BD, as well as to support passive information transmission from the BD to the PR. To do so, the full-duplex BD absorbs a fraction of the incident signal from the PT to decode the common messages and simultaneously transmits its own information to the PR by backscattering the remaining part of the incident signal. We derive the achievable rates of the BD transmission with Gaussian and quadrature amplitude modulation codewords. We also formulate a transmit power minimization problem by jointly designing the beamforming vector at the PT and the power splitting factor at the BD. This problem is first solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique together with a one-dimensional linear exhaustive search over the power splitting factor. Then, a suboptimal but low-complexity solution with closed-form expressions is proposed. The simulation results have shown that the proposed suboptimal solution achieves almost the same performance as that obtained by the exhaustive search. In addition, our proposed SR system with the full-duplex BD outperforms the half-duplex system with the time-division-multiplexing mode in general.},

abstract = {In order to satisfy the power demands of IoT devices and thus extend their lifespan, radio frequency (RF) signal aided wireless power transfer (WPT) is exploited for remote charging. Carefully coordinating both the WPT and wireless information transfer (WIT) yields an emerging research trend in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). However, SWIPT systems designed by assuming Gaussian distributed input signals may suffer from a substantial performance degradation in practice, when the finite alphabetical input is considered. In this article, we will provide a design guide of coding controlled SWIPT and study the modulation design in both single-user and multi-user SWIPT systems. We hope this guide may push SWIPT a step closer from theory to practice.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising solution to enhance the wireless communication capacity both cost-effectively and energy-efficiently, by properly altering the signal propagation via tuning a large number of passive reflecting units. In this paper, we aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of IRS-aided point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with multi-antenna transmitter and receiver in general, by jointly optimizing the IRS reflection coefficients and the MIMO transmit covariance matrix. First, we consider narrowband transmission under frequency-flat fading channels, and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance matrix or one of the reflection coefficients with the others being fixed. Next, we consider capacity maximization for broadband transmission in a general MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective fading channels, where transmit covariance matrices can be optimized for different subcarriers while only one common set of IRS reflection coefficients can be designed to cater to all subcarriers. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose a new alternating optimization algorithm based on convex relaxation to find a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve substantially increased capacity compared to traditional MIMO channels without the IRS, and also outperform various benchmark schemes. In particular, it is shown that with the proposed algorithms, various key parameters of the IRS-aided MIMO channel such as channel total power, rank, and condition number can be significantly improved for capacity enhancement.},

FSS is a periodic surface with identical two-dimensional arrays of elements arranged on a dielectric substrate. An incoming plane wave will either be transmitted (passband) or reflected back (stopband), completely or partially, depending on the nature of array element. This occurs when the frequency of electromagnetic (EM) wave matches with the resonant frequency of the FSS elements. Therefore, an FSS is capable of passing or blocking the EM waves of certain range of frequencies in the free space; consequently, identified as spatial filters. Nowadays, FSSs have been studied comprehensively and huge growth is perceived in the field of its designing and implementation for different practical applications at frequency ranges of microwave to optical. In this review article, we illustrate the recent researches on different categories of FSSs based on structure design, array element used, and applications. We also focus on theoretical breakthroughs with fabrication techniques, experimental verifications of design examples as well as prospects and challenges, especially in the microwave regime. We emphasize their significant performance parameters, particularly focusing on how advancement in this field could facilitate innovation in advanced electromagnetics.},

Specifically, an IRS-assisted SWIPT system is considered, where a multi-antenna aided base station (BS) communicates with several multi-antenna assisted information receivers (IRs), while guaranteeing the energy harvesting requirement of the energy receivers (ERs). To maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of IRs, the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices of the BS and passive phase shift matrix of the IRS should be jointly optimized. To tackle this challenging optimization problem, we first adopt the classic block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for decoupling the original optimization problem into several subproblems and alternatively optimize the TPC matrices and the phase shift matrix. For each subproblem, we provide a low-complexity iterative algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of each subproblem. The BCD algorithm is rigorously proved to converge to the KKT point of the original problem. We also conceive a feasibility checking method to study its feasibility. Our extensive simulation results confirm that employing IRSs in SWIPT beneficially enhances the system performance and the proposed BCD algorithm converges rapidly, which is appealing for practical applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study blind channel-and-signal estimation by exploiting the burst-sparse structure of angular-domain propagation channels in massive MIMO systems. The state-of-the-art approach utilizes the structured channel sparsity by sampling the angular-domain channel representation with a uniform angle-sampling grid, a.k.a. virtual channel representation. However, this approach is only applicable to uniform linear arrays and may cause a substantial performance loss due to the mismatch between the virtual representation and the true angle information. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sparse channel representation with a super-resolution sampling grid and a hidden Markovian support. Based on this, we develop a novel approximate inference based blind estimation algorithm to estimate the channel and the user signals simultaneously, with emphasis on the adoption of the expectation-maximization method to learn the angle information. Furthermore, we demonstrate the low-complexity implementation of our algorithm, making use of factor graph and message passing principles to compute the marginal posteriors. Numerical results show that our proposed method significantly reduces the estimation error compared to the state-of-the-art approach under various settings, which verifies the efficiency and robustness of our method.},

abstract = {A new line of research on communications and signals design for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has recently emerged in the communication literature. Promising signal strategies to maximize the power transfer efficiency of WPT rely on (energy) beamforming, waveform, modulation and transmit diversity, and a combination thereof. The study of those strategies has so far been limited to theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we study the real over-the-air performance of all the aforementioned signal strategies for WPT. To that end, we have designed, prototyped and experimented an innovative radiative WPT architecture based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR) that can operate in open-loop and closed-loop (with channel acquisition at the transmitter) modes. The prototype consists of three important blocks, namely the channel estimator, the signal generator, and the energy harvester. The experiments have been conducted in a variety of deployments, including frequency flat and frequency selective channels, under static and mobility conditions. Experiments highlight that a channel-adaptive WPT architecture relying on a 2-transmit antenna 16-sinewave waveform offers a 350$\backslash${\%} performance improvement in harvested DC power over a conventional single-antenna continuous wave. The experimental results fully validate the observations predicted from the theoretical signal designs and confirm the crucial and beneficial role played by the energy harvester nonlinearity.},

In this paper, our objectives were to realize harvester operation at typical ambient RF power levels found within urban and semi-urban environments. To explore the potential for ambient RF energy harvesting, a city-wide RF spectral survey was undertaken from outside all of the 270 London Underground stations at street level. Using the results from this survey, four harvesters (comprising antenna, impedance-matching network, rectifier, maximum power point tracking interface, and storage element) were designed to cover four frequency bands from the largest RF contributors (DTV, GSM900, GSM1800, and 3G) within the ultrahigh frequency (0.3-3 GHz) part of the frequency spectrum. Prototypes were designed and fabricated for each band. The overall end-to-end efficiency of the prototypes using realistic input RF power sources is measured; with our first GSM900 prototype giving an efficiency of 40{\%}. Approximately half of the London Underground stations were found to be suitable locations for harvesting ambient RF energy using our four prototypes. Furthermore, multiband array architectures were designed and fabricated to provide a broader freedom of operation. Finally, an output dc power density comparison was made between all the ambient RF energy harvesters, as well as alternative energy harvesting technologies, and for the first time, it is shown that ambient RF harvesting can be competitive with the other technologies.{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

A special case of the problem that we study corresponds to the max-3-cut model used in a recent paper of Goemans and Williamson [J. Comput. System Sci., 68 (2004), pp. 442-470]. We first develop a closed-form formula to compute the probability of a complex-valued normally distributed bivariate random vector to be in a given angular region. This formula allows us to compute the expected value of a randomized (with a specific rounding rule) solution based on the optimal solution of the complex semidefinite programming relaxation problem.

We show that if the objective is to maximize a positive semidefinite Hermitian form, then the randomization-rounding procedure guarantees a worst-case performance ratio of $\pi$/4 ≈ 0.7854, which is better than the ratio of 2/$\pi$ ≈ 0.6366 for its counterpart in the real case due to Nesterov.

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new technology for achieving both spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication systems in the future. However, existing works on IRS mainly consider frequency-flat channels and assume perfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Motivated by the above, in this paper we study an IRS-enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective channels and propose a practical transmission protocol with channel estimation. First, to reduce the overhead in channel training as well as exploit the channel spatial correlation, we propose a novel IRS elements grouping method, where each group consists of a set of adjacent IRS elements that share a common reflection coefficient. Based on this method, we propose a practical transmission protocol where only the combined channel of each group needs to be estimated, thus substantially reducing the training overhead. Next, with any given grouping and estimated CSI, we formulate the problem to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation and the IRS passive array reflection coefficients. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by alternately optimizing the power allocation and the passive array coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the initialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the case without using IRS. Moreover, it is shown that there exists an optimal size for IRS elements grouping which achieves the maximum achievable rate due to the practical trade-off between the training overhead and IRS passive beamforming flexibility.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a multi-sine multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) system with the objective to increase the output DC power. We jointly optimize the multi-sine waveform and beamforming accounting for the rectenna nonlinearity, and consider two combining schemes for the rectennas at the receiver, namely DC and RF combinings. For DC combining, the waveform and transmit beamforming are optimized, as a function of the channel state information (CSI). For RF combining, the optimal transmit and receive beamformings are provided in closed form and the waveform is optimized. We also consider a practical RF combining circuit using phase shifter and RF power combiner and optimize the waveform, transmit beamforming, and analog receive beamforming adaptive to the CSI. Two types of performance evaluations, based on the nonlinear rectenna model and accurate and realistic circuit simulations, are provided. The evaluations demonstrate that the joint waveform and beamforming design can increase the output DC power by leveraging the beamforming gain, the frequency diversity gain, and the rectenna nonlinearity. It also shows that the joint waveform and beamforming design provides a higher output DC power than the beamforming-only design with a relative gain of 180{\%} in a two-transmit antenna sixteen-sinewave two-receive antenna setup.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study information-theoretic limits for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems employing a practical nonlinear radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) receiver. In particular, we consider a three-node system with one transmitter that broadcasts a common signal to separated information decoding (ID) and EH receivers. Owing to the nonlinearity of the EH receiver circuit, the efficiency of wireless power transfer depends significantly on the waveform of the transmitted signal. In this paper, we aim to answer the following fundamental question: What is the optimal input distribution of the transmit waveform that maximizes the rate of the ID receiver for a given required harvested power at the EH receiver? In particular, we study the capacity of a SWIPT system impaired by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) under average-power (AP) and peak-power (PP) constraints at the transmitter and an EH constraint at the EH receiver. Using Hermite polynomial bases, we prove that the optimal capacityachieving input distribution that maximizes the rate-energy region is unique and discrete with a finite number of mass points. Our numerical results show that the rate-energy region is enlarged for a larger PP constraint and that the rate loss of the considered SWIPT system compared to the AWGN channel without EH receiver is reduced by increasing the AP budget.},

abstract = {One of the key enablers of future wireless communications is constituted by massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which can improve the spectral efficiency by orders of magnitude. However, in existing massive MIMO systems, conventional phased arrays are used for beamforming, which result in excessive power consumption and hardware cost. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the revolutionary technologies to enable energy-efficient and smart wireless communications, which is a two-dimensional structure with a large number of passive elements. In this paper, we propose and develop a new type of high-gain yet low-cost RIS having 256 elements. The proposed RIS combines the functions of phase shift and radiation together on an electromagnetic surface, where positive intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are used to realize 2-bit phase shifting for beamforming. Based on this radical design, the world's first wireless communication prototype using RIS having 256 2-bit elements is designed and developed. Specifically, the prototype conceived consists of modular hardware and flexible software, including the hosts for parameter setting and data exchange, the universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for baseband and radio frequency (RF) signal processing, as well as the RIS for signal transmission and reception. Our performance evaluation confirms the feasibility and efficiency of RISs in future wireless communications. More particularly, it is shown that a 21.7 dBi antenna gain can be obtained by the proposed RIS at 2.3 GHz, while at the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, i.e., 28.5 GHz, a 19.1 dBi antenna gain can be achieved. Furthermore, the over-the-air (OTA) test results show that the RIS-based wireless communication prototype developed is capable of significantly reducing the power consumption.},

The new matrix rank-one decomposition theorems appear to have wide applications in theory as well as in practice. On the theoretical side, for example, we show how to further extend some of the classical results including a lemma due to Yuan (Math Program 47:53-63, 1990), the classical results on the convexity of the joint numerical ranges (Pang and Zhang in Unpublished Manuscript, 2004; Au-Yeung and Poon in Southeast Asian Bull Math 3:85-92, 1979), and the so-called Finsler's lemma (Bohnenblust in Unpublished Manuscript; Au-Yeung and Poon in Southeast Asian Bull Math 3:85-92, 1979). On the practical side, we show that the new results can be applied to solve two typical problems in signal processing and communication: one for radar code optimization and the other for robust beamforming. The new matrix decomposition theorems are proven by construction in this paper, and we demonstrate that the constructive procedures can be implemented efficiently, stably, and accurately. The URL of our Matlab programs is given in this paper. We strongly believe that the new decomposition procedures, as a means to solve non-convex quadratic optimization with a few quadratic constraints, are useful for many other potential engineering applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer and Mathematical Programming Society.},

abstract = {High-efficiency rectennas for radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting have been studied for decades, but most of the literature straightforwardly applies the rectenna aiming at dedicated RF sources to this situation, even though the level of input power is significantly different. Since previous studies address antenna design collecting more ambient RF power, the improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) has emerged in a scattered way, because the theoretical limit of PCE has not yet been characterized, and the optimal rectenna structure approaching such maximum PCE is still uninvestigated. In this paper, we characterize the performance limit of rectennas with input power ranging from -20 to 0 dBm, proposing optimal rectenna design demonstrating the maximum PCE. The maximum achievable PCE is cast into a mathematical programming problem. Solving this optimization model clarifies the effect of design factors, including operational frequencies, rectifier topologies, and parameterization. To achieve the maximum PCE, our investigation shows that the optimal rectenna structure should not only optimize those design factors but also eliminate the matching circuit between an antenna and a rectifier for ultralow-power scenarios. The resultant PCE at 2.45 GHz is 61.4{\%} and 31.8{\%} at -5 and -15 dBm, respectively, closely approaching the theoretical bound.},

abstract = {The design of wireless information and power transfer (WIPT) has so far relied on an oversimplified and inaccurate linear model of the energy harvester. In this paper, we depart from this linear model and design WIPT considering the rectifier nonlinearity. We develop a tractable model of the rectifier nonlinearity that is flexible enough to cope with general multicarrier modulated input waveforms. Leveraging that model, we motivate and introduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition of multicarrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The superposed WIPT waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state information so as to characterize the rate-energy region of the whole system. Analysis and numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived waveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically changes the design of WIPT. We make key and refreshing observations. First, analysis (confirmed by circuit simulations) shows that modulated and unmodulated waveforms are not equally suitable for wireless power delivery, namely, modulation being beneficial in single-carrier transmissions but detrimental in multicarrier transmissions. Second, a multicarrier unmodulated waveform (superposed to a multicarrier modulated waveform) is useful to enlarge the rate-energy region of WIPT. Third, a combination of power splitting and time sharing is in general the best strategy. Fourth, a nonzero mean Gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity-Achieving zero-mean Gaussian input distribution in multicarrier transmissions. Fifth, the rectifier nonlinearity is beneficial to system performance and is essential to efficient WIPT design.},

abstract = {When simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is carried out, a fundamental tradeoff between achievable rate and harvested energy exists because the received power is used for two different purposes. The tradeoff is well characterized by the rate-energy region, and several techniques have been proposed to improve the achievable rate-energy region. However, the existing techniques still have a considerable loss in either energy or rate and thus the known achievable rate-energy regions are far from the ideal one. Deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the rate-energy region of our proposed scheme, we prove that the rate-energy region can be expanded almost to the ideal upper bound. Contrary to the existing techniques, in the proposed scheme, the information decoding circuit not only extracts amplitude and phase information but also combines the extracted information with the amplitude information obtained from the rectified signal. Consequently, the required energy for decoding can be minimized, and thus the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal rate-energy region, which implies that the fundamental tradeoff in the achievable rate-energy region is nearly eliminated. To practically account for the theoretically achievable rate-energy region, we also present practical examples with an M -ary multi-level circular QAM with Gaussian maximum likelihood detection.},

To prevent confidential information leakage, multiple artificial redundant signals (MARSs) are embedded in the transmit signals. The goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming vectors and the covariance matrixes of MARSs, such that the minimal information rate and EH requirements at IRs and ERs are guaranteed while making the received signal-to-Interference ratio at ERs and Eves lower than their information decoding thresholds. Both the non-robust and the robust designs are studied. For the non-robust design, the optimal solution is derived. For the robust design, an approximate optimal solution is obtained by using Gaussian randomization procedure. Simulation results show that compared with traditional non-MARS-aided beamforming design, our proposed design is superior in terms of the total required transmit power. It also shows that employing the non-linear EH model can avoid false output power at the ERs and/or save power at the transmitter.},

To characterize the performance of the proposed selection schemes, closed-form expressions for the outage probability and system throughput are derived. These analytical results demonstrate that the use of SWIPT will not jeopardize the diversity gain compared to the conventional NOMA. The proposed results confirm that the opportunistic use of node locations for user selection can achieve low outage probability and deliver superior throughput in comparison to the random selection scheme.},

abstract = {The low efficiency of far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) limits the fundamental rate-energy (R-E) performance trade-off of the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. To address this challenge, we propose in this letter a new SWIPT system aided by the emerging intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS achieve a high passive beamforming gain, which is appealing for drastically enhancing the WPT efficiency and thereby the R-E trade-off of SWIPT systems. We consider an IRS being deployed to assist a multi-antenna access point (AP) to serve multiple information decoding receivers (IDRs) and energy harvesting receivers (EHRs). We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power received by EHRs via jointly optimizing the transmit precoders at the AP and reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for IDRs. Since this problem is non-convex, we propose efficient algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions for it. In particular, we prove that it is sufficient to send information signals only at the AP to serve both IDRs and EHRs regardless of their channel realizations. Moreover, simulation results show significant performance gains achieved by our proposed designs over benchmark schemes.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) that enables the control of the wireless propagation environment has been looked upon as a promising technology for boosting the spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless communication systems. Prior works on IRS are mainly based on an ideal phase shift model with full reflection regardless of phase shift, which, however, is practically difficult to realize. In contrast, we propose in this letter a practical phase shift model that captures the phase dependent amplitude in the reflection coefficient. Applying this new model to an IRS-aided wireless system, we formulate a problem to maximize its achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the IRS reflect beamforming. The formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to be optimally solved in general, for which we propose a low-complexity suboptimal solution based on the alternating optimization (AO) technique. Simulation results unveil a substantial performance gain achieved by the joint beamforming optimization based on the proposed phase shift model as compared to the conventional ideal model.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in downlink multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where the users harvest energy and decode information using the same signals received from a fixed access point (AP). For information transmission, we consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). At the receiver side, due to the practical limitation that circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly, each user applies either time switching (TS) or power splitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ TS at the receivers; for the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS at the receivers. Under the above two scenarios, we address the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency power allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested energy constraint on each user as well as a peak and/or total transmission power constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate variable transformation the problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal power allocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS scheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation, subcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS ratio for each user. The performances of the two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically for the special case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power constraint imposed on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system play key roles in the rate-energy performance comparison by the two proposed schemes. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Terahertz (THz) band provides huge bandwidth but the molecular absorptions in these frequencies cause high path losses in long-distance communications. Recently, multi-band ultra-massive MIMO (UM-MIMO) systems based on graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas have been proposed to overcome the distance problem. In the UM MIMO systems, the mutual coupling effect is a challenging problem because of the ultra-dense integration of the multi-band nano-antenna arrays. In this paper, a graphene-based frequency selective surface (FSS) is proposed to reduce the coupling effects in dense plasmonic nano-antenna arrays for multi-band UM MIMO systems. The performance of the proposed structure is evaluated by full-wave simulation for different cases. The results show that the FSS structure has a wide stopband (-15 dB bandwidth, approximately 43{\%}-50{\%}) from 1.1 to 1.7 THz. By inserting the FSS structure between nano-antennas, a high isolation coefficient of -25 dB with a 15 dB fall and an envelope correlation coefficient of less than 0.01 are achieved. The field distributions and the radiation patterns are also presented to confirm that the proposed FSS structure improves the performance of the array with negligible influence on the antenna itself. Moreover, the receiving mode simulation of the array is performed with the FSS structure. It is also asymptotically shown that the mutual coupling experienced by the nano-antenna with the FSS structure is negligible even in the presence of a very large number of closely integrated elements. Finally, the technological issues are discussed for practical implementations.},

Finally, a novel iterative algorithm based on both the herein derived CSI error vector and the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is contributed, which is shown to capable of efficiently solving the constrained min-power problem.

abstract = {Due to its promising performance in a wide range of practical scenarios, Rate-Splitting (RS) has recently received significant attention in academia for the downlink of communication systems. In this letter, we propose and analyse a Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) strategy based on the three-node relay channel where the transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas. By splitting user messages and linearly precoding common and private streams at the transmitter, and opportunistically asking the relaying user to forward its decoded common message, CRS can efficiently cope with a wide range of propagation conditions (disparity of user channel strengths and directions) and compensate for the performance degradation due to deep fading. The precoder design and the resource allocation are optimized by solving the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) maximization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed CRS scheme can achieve an explicit rate region improvement compared to its non-cooperative counterpart and other cooperative strategies (such as cooperative NOMA).},

abstract = {This paper studies an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. In this system, a multi-antenna access point (AP) uses transmit beamforming to send both information and energy signals to a set of receivers each for information decoding (ID) or energy harvesting (EH), and a dedicatedly deployed IRS properly controls its reflecting phase shifts to form passive reflection beams for facilitating both ID and EH at receivers. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the (active) information and energy transmit beamforming at the AP together with the (passive) reflective beamforming at the IRS, to maximize the minimum power received at all EH receivers, subject to individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at ID receivers, and the maximum transmit power constraint at the AP. Although the formulated SINR-constrained min-energy maximization problem is highly non-convex, we present an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution by using the techniques of alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results show that the proposed IRS-assisted SWIPT system with both information and energy signals achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes without IRS deployed and/or without dedicated energy signals used.},

Over the last few years, GP has been used to solve a variety of problems in the analysis and design of communication systems in several 'layers' in the communication network architecture, including information theory problems, signal processing algorithms, basic queuing system optimization, many network resource allocation problems such as power control and congestion control, and cross-layer design. We also start to understand why, in addition to how, GP can be applied to a surprisingly wide range of problems in communication systems. These applications have in turn spurred new research activities on GP, especially generalizations of GP formulations and development of distributed algorithms to solve GP in a network. This text provides both an in-depth tutorial on the theory, algorithms, and modeling methods of GP, and a comprehensive survey on the applications of GP to the study of communication systems.},

abstract = {User cooperation is an effective technique to tackle the severe near-far user unfairness problem in wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). In this paper, we consider a WPCN where two collaborating wireless devices (WDs) first harvest wireless energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then transmit their information to the HAP. The WD with the stronger WD-to-HAP channel helps relay the message of the other weaker user. In particular, we exploit the use of ambient backscatter communication during the wireless energy transfer phase, where the weaker user backscatters the received energy signal to transmit its information to the relay user in a passive manner. By doing so, the relay user can reuse the energy signal for simultaneous energy harvesting and information decoding (e.g., using an energy detector). Compared to active information transmission in conventional WPCNs, the proposed method effectively saves the energy and time consumed by the weaker user on information transmission during cooperation. With the proposed backscatter-assisted relaying scheme, we jointly optimize the time and power allocations on wireless energy and information transmissions to maximize the common throughput. Specifically, we derive the semi-closed-form expressions of the optimal solution and propose a low-complexity optimal algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem. By comparing with some representative benchmark methods, we simulate under extensive network setups and demonstrate that the proposed cooperation method effectively improves the throughput performance in WPCNs.},

Recently, significant progress has been made on the design of the transmit multisine waveform, adaptive to the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), in a point-to-point backscatter system. In this paper, we leverage the work and study the design of the transmit multisine waveform in a multiuser backscatter system, made of one transmitter, one reader, and multiple tags active simultaneously. We derive an efficient algorithm to optimize the transmit waveform so as to identify the tradeoff between the amount of energy harvested at the tags and the reliability of the communication, measured in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the reader. The performance with the optimized waveform based on the linear and nonlinear EH models is studied. The numerical results demonstrate the benefits of accounting for the EH nonlinearity, multiuser diversity, frequency diversity, and multisine waveform adaptive to the CSIT to enlarge the SINR-energy region.},

In our concept, NOMA adopts a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver as the baseline receiver scheme for robust multiple access, considering the expected evolution of device processing capabilities in the future. Based on system-level evaluations, we show that the downlink NOMA with SIC improves both the capacity and cell-edge user throughput performance irrespective of the availability of the frequency-selective channel quality indicator (CQI) on the base station side. Furthermore, we discuss possible extensions of NOMA by jointly applying multi-antenna/site technologies with a proposed NOMA/MIMO scheme using SIC and an interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver to achieve further capacity gains, e.g., a three-fold gain in the spectrum efficiency representing a challenging target for FRA. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Currently, the community is experiencing a paradigm shift in wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiation as well as the network infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. In this paper, we review and discuss recent progress in laying the foundations of the envisioned dual purpose networks by establishing a signal theory and design for wireless information and power transmission (WIPT) and identifying the fundamental tradeoff between conveying information and power wirelessly. We start with an overview of WIPT challenges and technologies, namely, simultaneous WIPT (SWIPT), wirelessly powered communication networks (WPCNs), and wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WPBC). We then characterize energy harvesters and show how WIPT signal and system designs crucially revolve around the underlying energy harvester model. To that end, we highlight three different energy harvester models, namely, one linear model and two nonlinear models, and show how WIPT designs differ for each of them in single-user and multi-user deployments. Topics discussed include rate-energy region characterization, transmitter and receiver architectures, waveform design, modulation, beamforming and input distribution optimizations, resource allocation, and RF spectrum use. We discuss and check the validity of the different energy harvester models and the resulting signal theory and design based on circuit simulations, prototyping, and experimentation. We also point out numerous directions that are promising for future research.},

In this paper, we study an IRS- enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in which an IRS is deployed to assist the communication between a nearby user and its associated base station (BS). We aim to maximize the downlink achievable rate for the user by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the passive array reflection coefficients at the IRS. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by alternately optimizing the BS's power allocation and the IRS's passive array coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the initialization.

abstract = {Nonlinear energy harvesters (EH) behave differently depending on the range of their input power. In the literature, different models have been proposed mainly for relatively small and large input power regimes of an EH. Due to the complexity of the proposed nonlinear models, obtaining analytical optimal or well performing signal designs have been extremely challenging. Relying on the proposed models in the literature, the learning problem of modulation design for simultaneous wireless information-power transfer (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using neural network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that for relatively small channel input powers, as the power demand increases at the receiver, one of the symbols is shot away from the origin while the remaining symbols approach zero amplitude. In the very extreme case of merely receiver power demand, the modulations are in the form of On-Off keying signalling with a low probability of the On signal. On the other side, for relatively large channel input powers, it is observed that as the receiver power demand increases, a number of symbols approach zero amplitude, whereas the others (more than one symbol) get equally high amplitudes but with different phases. In the extreme scenario of merely receiver power demand, the modulation resembles multiple On-Off keying signalling with different phases.},

The optimization problem of maximizing rate-power (RP) region is studied. Assuming that the channel state information (CSI) is available at both the receiver and the transmitter, and constraining to the non-zero mean Gaussian input distributions, an optimization algorithm for power allocation among different subchannels is studied. As a special case, optimality conditions for zero mean Gaussian inputs are derived. Results obtained from the numerical optimization demonstrate the superiority of the non-zero mean Gaussian inputs (with asymmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) in yielding a larger RP region compared to their zero mean and non-zero mean (with symmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) counterparts. The results motivate the design of new modulation for SWIPT and contrast with the SWIPT design under linear energy harvesting, for which the circularly symmetric Gaussian inputs with water-filling power allocation are optimal.},

abstract = {In this paper we study semidefinite programming (SDP) models for a class of discrete and continuous quadratic optimization problems in the complex Hermitian form. These problems capture a class of well-known combinatorial optimization problems, as well as problems in control theory. For instance, they include the MAX-3-CUT problem where the Laplacian matrix is positive semidefinite (in particular, some of the edge weights can be negative). We present a generic algorithm and a unified analysis of the SDP relaxations which allow us to obtain good approximation guarantees for our models. Specifically, we give an (k sin($\pi$/k))2/(4$\pi$) -approximation algorithm for the discrete problem where the decision variables are k-ary and the objective matrix is positive semidefinite. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known approximation result for this family of problems. For the continuous problem where the objective matrix is positive semidefinite, we obtain the well-known $\pi$ /4 result due to Ben-Tal et al.

However, our techniques simplify their analyses and provide a unified framework for treating those problems. In addition, we show for the first time that the gap between the optimal value of the original problem and that of the SDP relaxation can be arbitrarily close to $\pi$ /4. We also show that the unified analysis can be used to obtain an $\Omega$(1/ log n)-approximation algorithm for the continuous problem in which the objective matrix is not positive semidefinite. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {In recent years, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique has been at the center of some of very exciting developments in the area of signal processing and communications, and it has shown great significance and relevance on a variety of applications. Roughly speaking, SDR is a powerful, computationally efficient approximation technique for a host of very difficult optimization problems. In particular, it can be applied to many nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) in an almost mechanical fashion, including the following problem: min x[Rn xTCx s.t. xTFi x {\$} gi, i51,c, p, xTHi x5li, i51,c, q, (1) where the given matrices C, F1,c, Fp, H1,c, Hq are assumed to be general real symmetric matrices, possibly indefinite. The class of nonconvex QCQPs (1) captures many problems that are of interest to the signal processing and communications community. For instance, consider the Boolean quadratic program (BQP) min x[Rn xTCx s.t. xi 2 51, i51,c, n. (2) The BQP is long known to be a computationally difficult problem. In particular, it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, being able to handle the BQP well has an enormous impact on multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) detection and multiuser detection. Another important yet NP-hard problem in the nonconvex QCQP class (1) is min x[Rn xTCx s.t. xTFix {\$} 1, i51,c, m, (3) where C, F1,c, Fm are all positive semidefinite. Problem (3) captures the multicast downlink transmit beamforming problem; see [1] for details. An illustration of an instance of (3) is provided in Figure 1. As seen from the figure, the feasible set of (3) is the intersection of the exteriors of multiple ellipsoids, which makes the problem difficult. As a matter of fact, SDR has been studied and applied in the optimization community long before it made its impact on signal processing and communications. The idea of SDR can be found in an early paper of Lov{\'{a}}sz in 1979 [2], but it was arguably the seminal work of Goemans and Williamson in 1995 [3] that sparked the significant interest in and rapid development of SDR techniques. In that work, it was shown that SDR can be used to provide an approximation accuracy of no worse than 0.8756 for the maximum cut problem (the BQP with some conditions on C). In other words, even though the maximum cut problem is NP-hard, one could efficiently obtain a solution whose objective value is at least 0.8756 times the optimal value using SDR. Since then, we have seen a number of dedicated theoretical analyses that establish the SDR approximation accuracy under different problem settings [3]–[11] and that have greatly improved our understanding of the capabilities of SDR. Today, we are even able to pin down a number of conditions under which SDR provides an exact optimal solution to the original problem [7], [12]–[16].},

In contrast with the literature that relies on an inaccurate linear model of the energy harvester, an experimentally-validated nonlinear model is considered. A general form of the delivered Direct Current (DC) power in terms of system baseband parameters is derived, which demonstrates the dependency of the delivered DC power on higher order statistics of the channel input distribution. The optimization problem of maximizing Rate-Power (R-P) region is studied. Assuming that the Channel gain is known at both the receiver and the transmitter, and constraining to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel inputs determined only by their first and second moment statistics, an inner bound for the general problem is obtained. Notably, as a consequence of the harvester nonlinearity, the studied inner bound exhibits a tradeoff between the delivered power and the rate of received information. It is shown that the tradeoff-characterizing input distribution is with mean zero and with asymmetric power allocations to the real and imaginary dimensions.},

abstract = {Simultaneous information and power transfer over the wireless channels potentially offers great convenience to mobile users. Yet practical receiver designs impose technical constraints on its hardware realization, as practical circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a general receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits the received signal with adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and information decoding, separately. Three special cases of DPS, namely, time switching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting (OPS) are investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of OPS. Moreover, we propose two types of practical receiver architectures, namely, separated versus integrated information and energy receivers. The integrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated receiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for the two architectures are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. The optimal transmission strategy is derived to achieve different rate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption taken into account, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. For the ideal case when the receiver circuit does not consume power, the SPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. In addition, we study the performance for the two types of receivers under a realistic system setup that employs practical modulation. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal practical receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). {\textcopyright} 1972-2012 IEEE.},

In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things, LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and Dash7 alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

abstract = {The explosion of the number of low-power devices in the next decades calls for a re-thinking of wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum, radiation, and infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. This paper provides a novel learning-based approach towards such wireless network design. To that end, a parametric model of a practical energy harvester, accounting for various sources of nonlinearities, is proposed using a nonlinear regression algorithm applied over collected real data. Relying on the proposed model, the learning problem of modulation design for Simultaneous Wireless Information-Power Transmission (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using Neural Network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that by increasing the receiver power demand, the baseband transmit modulation constellation converges to an On-Off keying signalling. Utilizing the observations obtained via learning, an algorithmic SWIPT modulation design is proposed. It is observed via numerical results that the performance loss of the proposed modulations are negligible compared to the ones obtained from learning. Extension of the studied problem to learning modulation design for multi-user SWIPT scenarios and coded modulation design for point-to-point SWIPT are considered. The major conclusion of this work is to utilize learning-based results to design non learning-based algorithms, which perform as well. In particular, inspired by the results obtained via learning, an algorithmic approach for coded modulation design is proposed, which performs very close to its learning counterparts, and is significantly superior due to its high real-time adaptability to new system design parameters.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications and design aspects of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the future wireless networks. Conventionally, the network optimization has been limited to transmission control at two endpoints, i.e., end users and network controller. The fading wireless channel is uncontrollable and becomes one of the main limiting factors for performance improvement. The IRS is composed of a large array of scattering elements, which can be individually configured to generate additional phase shifts to the signal reflections. Hence, it can actively control the signal propagation properties in favor of signal reception, and thus realize the notion of a smart radio environment. As such, the IRS's phase control combined with the conventional transmission control can potentially bring performance gain compared to the conventional wireless networks without using the IRS. In this survey, we first introduce basic concepts of the IRS and the realizations of its reconfigurability. Then, we focus on applications of the IRS in wireless communications. We overview different performance metrics and analytical approaches to characterize the performance improvement of IRS-assisted wireless networks. To exploit the performance gain, we discuss the joint optimization of the IRS's phase control and the transceivers' transmission control in different network design problems, e.g., rate maximization and power minimization problems. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of IRS-assisted wireless networks to some emerging wireless applications. Finally, we highlight important practical challenges and future research directions of realizing IRS-assisted wireless communications in beyond 5G networks.},

Motivated by applications, such as single-molecule imaging, radar imaging, etc., we consider parameter estimation of complex exponentials from their modulations with unknown waveforms, allowing for non-stationary blind super-resolution. This problem, however, is ill-posed since both the parameters associated with the complex exponentials and the modulating waveforms are unknown. To alleviate this, we assume that the unknown waveforms live in a common low-dimensional subspace. Using a lifting trick, we recast the blind super-resolution problem as a structured low-rank matrix recovery problem. Atomic norm minimization is then used to enforce the structured low-rankness, and is reformulated as a semidefinite program that is solvable in polynomial time. We show that, up to scaling ambiguities, exact recovery of both of the complex exponential parameters and the unknown waveforms is possible when the waveform subspace is random and the number of measurements is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the problem. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings, showing that non-stationary blind super-resolution using atomic norm minimization is possible.},

By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS achieve a high passive beamforming gain, which is appealing for drastically enhancing the WPT efficiency and thereby the R-E trade-off of SWIPT systems. We consider an IRS being deployed to assist a multi-antenna access point (AP) to serve multiple information decoding receivers (IDRs) and energy harvesting receivers (EHRs). We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power received by EHRs via jointly optimizing the transmit precoders at the AP and reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for IDRs. Since this problem is non-convex, we propose efficient algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions for it. In particular, we prove that it is sufficient to send information signals only at the AP to serve both IDRs and EHRs regardless of their channel realizations. Moreover, simulation results show significant performance gains achieved by our proposed designs over benchmark schemes.},

These systems face two important challenges: (i) the large training overhead associated with selecting the optimal beam and (ii) the reliability challenge due to the high sensitivity to link blockages. Interestingly, most of the devices that employ mmWave arrays will likely also use cameras, such as 5G phones, self-driving vehicles, and virtual/augmented reality headsets. Therefore, we investigate the potential gains of employing cameras at the mmWave base stations and leveraging their visual data to help overcome the beam selection and blockage prediction challenges. To do that, this paper exploits computer vision and deep learning tools to predict mmWave beams and blockages directly from the camera RGB images and the sub-6GHz channels. The experimental results reveal interesting insights into the effectiveness of such solutions. For example, the deep learning model is capable of achieving over 90$\backslash${\%} beam prediction accuracy, which only requires snapping a shot of the scene and zero overhead.},
