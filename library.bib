abstract = {In this paper, we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless secure communication system, where an IRS is deployed to adjust its reflecting elements to secure the communication of multiple legitimate users in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. Aiming to improve the system secrecy rate, a design problem for jointly optimizing the base station (BS)'s beamforming and the IRS's reflecting beamforming is formulated considering different quality of service (QoS) requirements and time-varying channel conditions. As the system is highly dynamic and complex, and it is challenging to address the non-convex optimization problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based secure beamforming approach is firstly proposed to achieve the optimal beamforming policy against eavesdroppers in dynamic environments. Furthermore, post-decision state (PDS) and prioritized experience replay (PER) schemes are utilized to enhance the learning efficiency and secrecy performance. Specifically, a modified PDS scheme is presented to trace the channel dynamic and adjust the beamforming policy against channel uncertainty accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep PDS-PER learning based secure beamforming approach can significantly improve the system secrecy rate and QoS satisfaction probability in IRS-aided secure communication systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study of the optimal performance of multitone signals in low RF-power transfer and energy harvesters. The choice of the load can be tricky, showing an advantage of a certain type of signals over another. For low RF power (-17dBm), the multitone signals do not improve the peak RF-to-dc power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the continuous wave (CW) single-tone signal, if the optimal load is selected for each case, however, the multitone signals maintain that peak PCE of ∼ 47{\%} over higher output voltage (i.e: larger loads), and consequently enable more efficient dc-to-dc voltage boosting or even eliminate the need for the voltage booster in the RF power receiver. Thus, the low-power multitone waveforms can be considered as a voltage sensitivity booster rather than a PCE efficiency booster. This boosted rectified voltage is the key advantage of the multitone signals that leads to the enhancement in the overall efficiency of the low-RF power receiver.},

abstract = {Multiple antenna technologies have attracted much research interest for several decades and have gradually made their way into mainstream communication systems. Two main benefits are adaptive beamforming gains and spatial multiplexing, leading to high data rates per user and per cell, especially when large antenna arrays are adopted. Since multiple antenna technology has become a key component of the fifth-generation (5G) networks, it is time for the research community to look for new multiple antenna technologies to meet the immensely higher data rate, reliability, and traffic demands in the beyond 5G era. Radically new approaches are required to achieve orders-of-magnitude improvements in these metrics. There will be large technical challenges, many of which are yet to be identified. In this paper, we survey three new multiple antenna technologies that can play key roles in beyond 5G networks: cell-free massive MIMO, beamspace massive MIMO, and intelligent reflecting surfaces. For each of these technologies, we present the fundamental motivation, key characteristics, recent technical progresses, and provide our perspectives for future research directions. The paper is not meant to be a survey/tutorial of a mature subject, but rather serve as a catalyst to encourage more research and experiments in these multiple antenna technologies.},

However, most existing NOMA schemes rely on the strong assumption that users{\&}{\#}x2019; channel gains are quite different, which may be invalid in practice. To unleash the potential of power-domain NOMA, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered NOMA scheme to introduce desirable channel gain differences among the users by adjusting the phase shifts at the RIS. Our goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors at the base station, the phase-shift matrix at the RIS, and user ordering. To address challenge due to the highly coupled optimization variables, we present an alternating optimization framework to decompose the non-convex bi-quadratically constrained quadratic problem under a specific user ordering into two rank-one constrained matrices optimization problems via matrix lifting. To accurately detect the feasibility of the non-convex rank-one constraints and improve performance by avoiding early stopping in the alternating optimization procedure, we equivalently represent the rank-one constraint as the difference between nuclear norm and spectral norm. A difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC programs via successive convex relaxation, followed by establishing the convergence of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method. We further propose an efficient user ordering scheme with closed-form expressions, considering both the channel conditions and users{\&}{\#}x2019; target data rates. Simulation results validate the ability of an RIS in enlarging the channel-gain difference when the users{\&}{\#}x2019; original channel conditions are similar and the superiority of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method in reducing the total transmit power.},

The principle behind these is to embed the information both in classic QAM/PSK symbols and in the transmitter beam-pattern.

Such performance is an order to three orders of magnitude better than the best known prior WiFi backscatter system [27,25].

abstract = {From 1G to 5G, wireless channels have been traditionally considered to be uncontrollable. Thanks to the recent advances in meta-materials, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a new paradigm for controlling wireless channels intelligently, thus making it a revolutionary technique for future 6G wireless communications. However, due to the "double fading" effect, RIS only achieves a negligible capacity gain in typical communication scenarios, which however has been widely ignored in many existing works. In this paper, the concept of active RIS is proposed to break this fundamental physical limit. Different from the existing passive RIS that reflects signals passively without amplification, active RIS can actively amplify the reflected signals. We then develop a signal model for active RIS, which is validated through experimental measurements. Based on this new signal model, we analyze the capacity gain achievable by active RIS and formulate the capacity maximization problem in an active RIS aided system. Next, a joint transmit and reflect precoding algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Finally, extensive results show that, compared with the baseline without RIS, the existing passive RIS can realize a negligible capacity gain of only 3{\%} in typical application scenarios, while the proposed active RIS can achieve a noticeable capacity gain of 129{\%}, thus overcoming the fundamental limit of "double fading" effect.},

The primary transmitter communicates with the IR and at the same time assists the IRS in forwarding information to the IR. Based on the IRS's symbol period, we distinguish two scenarios, namely, commensal SR (CSR) and parasitic SR (PSR), where two different techniques for decoding the IRS signals at the IR are employed. We formulate bit error rate (BER) minimization problems for both scenarios by jointly optimizing the active beamformer at the base station and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a minimum primary rate requirement. Specifically, for the CSR scenario, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution, where semi-closed-form solutions for the active beamformer and the IRS phase shifts are derived based on Lagrange duality and Majorization-Minimization methods, respectively. For the PSR scenario, we apply a bisection search-based method, successive convex approximation, and difference of convex programming to develop a computationally efficient algorithm, which converges to a locally optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show that the proposed SR techniques are able to achieve a lower BER than benchmark schemes.},

abstract = {Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) is expected to wirelessly connect billions of low-complexity devices. For wireless information transfer (IT) in IoT, high density of IoT devices and their ad hoc communication result in strong interference, which acts as a bottleneck on wireless IT. Furthermore, battery replacement for the massive number of IoT devices is difficult if not infeasible, making wireless energy transfer (ET) desirable. This motivates: 1) the design of full-duplex wireless IT to reduce latency and enable efficient spectrum utilization and 2) the implementation of passive IoT devices using backscatter antennas that enable wireless ET from one device (reader) to another (tag). However, the resultant increase in the density of simultaneous links exacerbates the interference issue. This issue is addressed in this paper by proposing the design of full-duplex backscatter communication (BackCom) networks, where a novel multiple-access scheme based on time-hopping spread-spectrum is designed to enable both one-way wireless ET and two-way wireless IT in coexisting backscatter reader-tag links. Comprehensive performance analysis of BackCom networks is presented in this paper, including forward/backward bit-error rates and wireless ET efficiency and outage probabilities, which accounts for energy harvesting at tags, non-coherent and coherent detection at tags and readers, respectively, and the effects of asynchronous transmissions.},

However, NOMA requires channel state information (CSI) at the receiver for coherent detection, resulting in unaffordable complexity in the channel estimation as the number of users goes large. Add to that, the introduction of massive MIMO makes the channel estimation even more challenging. In this letter, we propose a blind belief propagation (BP) detection for non-coherent NOMA with massive MIMO, where the transmitter of each user first performs differential modulation on PSK symbols, and then spreads its symbols using low-density spreading (LDS); the receiver of base station (BS) employs differential demodulation and then detects all users' symbols using a blind BP detection without knowledge of CSI. Simulation results show that the proposed blind BP detection can not only support the overloaded users, but also achieve BER performance very close to that of point-to-point systems.},

abstract = {It has been predicted theoretically that for some environments, the capacity of wireless multiple-input multiple-output systems can become very low even for uncorrelated signals; this effect has been termed "keyhole" or "pinhole". In this paper the first unique measurements of this effect are presented. The measurements were performed in a controlled indoor environment that was designed to obtain a keyhole channel. We analyze limitations due to measurement imperfections for measurement-based capacity calculations and keyhole investigations. We further present a bound for the higher eigenmodes as a function of the finite measurement signal-to-noise ratio and multipath component leakage. The bound is compared to the measurement results and shows excellent agreement. Finally, we analyze the envelope distribution and, as expected from theory, it follows a double-Rayleigh distribution. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently been envisioned to offer unprecedented massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-like gains by deploying large-scale and low-cost passive reflection elements. By adjusting the reflection coefficients, the IRS can change the phase shifts on the impinging electromagnetic waves so that it can smartly reconfigure the signal propagation environment and enhance the power of the desired received signal or suppress the interference signal. In this paper, we consider downlink multigroup multicast communication systems assisted by an IRS. We aim for maximizing the sum rate of all the multicasting groups by the joint optimization of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the reflection coefficients at the IRS under both the power and unit-modulus constraint. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose two efficient algorithms under the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm framework. Specifically, a concave lower bound surrogate objective function of each user's rate has been derived firstly, based on which two sets of variables can be updated alternately by solving two corresponding second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems. Then, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we derive another concave lower bound function of each group's rate for each set of variables at every iteration, and obtain the closed-form solutions under these loose surrogate objective functions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the benefits in terms of the spectral and energy efficiency of the introduced IRS and the effectiveness in terms of the convergence and complexity of our proposed algorithms.},

For DC combining, the waveform and transmit beamforming are optimized, as a function of the channel state information (CSI).

We also consider a practical RF combining circuit using phase shifter and RF power combiner and optimize the waveform, transmit beamforming, and analog receive beamforming adaptive to the CSI. Two types of performance evaluations, based on the nonlinear rectenna model and accurate and realistic circuit simulations, are provided. The evaluations demonstrate that the joint waveform and beamforming design can increase the output DC power by leveraging the beamforming gain, the frequency diversity gain, and the rectenna nonlinearity. It also shows that the joint waveform and beamforming design provides a higher output DC power than the beamforming-only design with a relative gain of 180{\%} in a two-transmit antenna sixteen-sinewave two-receive antenna setup.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has drawn a lot of attention recently as a promising new solution to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless communication systems. By utilizing massive low-cost passive reflecting elements, the wireless propagation environment becomes controllable and thus can be made favorable for improving the communication performance. Prior works on IRS mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), which, however, is practically difficult to obtain for IRS-associated links due to its passive operation and large number of elements. To overcome this difficulty, we propose in this paper a new two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol to maximize the achievable average sum-rate for an IRS-aided multiuser system under the general correlated Rician channel model. Specifically, the passive IRS phase-shifts are first optimized based on the statistical CSI (S-CSI) of all links, which varies much slowly as compared to their I-CSI, while the transmit beamforming/precoding vectors at the access point (AP) are then designed to cater to the I-CSI of the users' effective channels with the optimized IRS phase-shifts, thus significantly reducing the channel training overhead and passive beamforming complexity over the existing schemes based on the I-CSI of all channels. For the single-user case, a novel penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed, where the IRS phase-shifts are updated in parallel to reduce the computational time. For the multiuser case, we propose a general TTS optimization algorithm by constructing a quadratic surrogate of the objective function, which cannot be explicitly expressed in closed-form. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and evaluate the impact of S-CSI and channel correlation on the system performance.},

Based on the time switching (TS) and power splitting (PS) receiver architectures, two operating schemes are employed to enable energy harvesting and ambient backscattering at the ambient backscatter (AB) transmitter. In order to maximize the outage capacity for the AB transmitters, we formulate two optimization problems optimizing the TS and PS ratios. Two schemes with low complexity are proposed to obtain the near-optimal outage performance. Considering the coexistence of the AmBackComs and cellular downlink transmissions, successful transmission probabilities for AB transmitters and cellular downlink transmissions are both derived for the TS and PS schemes and provide insights on how various system parameters, such as the TS ratio, the PS ratio, the density of base stations (BSs)/AB transmitters, etc., impact the system performance. Numerical results show that the outage capacity for AmBackComs can be significantly improved by selecting a proper TS/PS ratio and our proposed schemes can achieve near-optimal outage capacities. The study also shows that many more ultra-low-power devices users can be connected via the proposed scheme at a cost of a slightly reduced overall network capacity.},

By inserting the FSS structure between the elements of the nano-antenna array, a high isolation of -25 dB with a 15 dB fall is achieved, which indicates that mutual decoupling effects are suppressed for both two-element and four-element arrays. The radiation patterns are given to confirm that the proposed FSS structure can improve the performance of multi-band THz antenna arrays with negligible influence on the nano-antenna radiation performance. Finally, it is asymptotically shown that the mutual coupling experienced by the nano-antenna with the FSS structure is negligible even in the presence of very large number of closely integrated elements.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising solution to enhance the wireless communication capacity both cost-effectively and energy-efficiently, by properly altering the signal propagation via tuning a large number of passive reflecting units. In this paper, we aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of IRS-aided point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with multi-antenna transmitter and receiver in general, by jointly optimizing the IRS reflection coefficients and the MIMO transmit covariance matrix. First, we consider narrowband transmission under frequency-flat fading channels, and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance matrix or one of the reflection coefficients with the others being fixed. Next, we consider capacity maximization for broadband transmission in a general MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective fading channels, where transmit covariance matrices can be optimized for different subcarriers while only one common set of IRS reflection coefficients can be designed to cater to all subcarriers. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose a new alternating optimization algorithm based on convex relaxation to find a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve substantially increased capacity compared to traditional MIMO channels without the IRS, and also outperform various benchmark schemes. In particular, it is shown that with the proposed algorithms, various key parameters of the IRS-aided MIMO channel such as channel total power, rank, and condition number can be significantly improved for capacity enhancement.},

Moreover, the controlled scattering can surpass natural behavior, exemplary overriding Snell's law, reflecting waves towards any custom angle (including negative ones). Thus, path loss and multi-path fading effects can be controlled and mitigated. The core technology of this new paradigm are metasurfaces, planar artificial structures whose effect on impinging electromagnetic waves is fully defined by their macro-structure. The present study contributes the software-programmable wireless environment model, consisting of several HyperSurface tiles controlled by a central, environment configuration server. HyperSurfaces are a novel class of metasurfaces whose structure and, hence, electromagnetic behavior can be altered and controlled via a software interface. Multiple networked tiles coat indoor objects, allowing fine-grained, customizable reflection, absorption or polarization overall. A central server calculates and deploys the optimal electromagnetic interaction per tile, to the benefit of communicating devices.

The concept of normalized power loss per bit is introduced for such RFID communication systems to capture the consequent trade-offs, that form the crux of the results. We explore the use of higher dimensional (4-QAM) modulation schemes in future RFID systems (beyond current binary modulation in Class-1 Gen 2) as a means to improve uplink bit rate. However, this results in significantly increased normalized power loss vis-a-vis 2-PSK, suggesting a role for FEC coding.

Powering the massive number of embedded devices is a key challenge of designing IoT, since batteries increase the devices' form factors and battery recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel network architecture that enables D2D communication between passive nodes by integrating wireless power transfer and backscatter communication, which is called a wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WP-BackCom) network. In this network, standalone power beacons (PBs) are deployed for wirelessly powering nodes by beaming unmodulated carrier signals to targeted nodes. Provisioned with a backscatter antenna, a node transmits data to an intended receiver by modulating and reflecting a fraction of a carrier signal. Such transmission by backscatter consumes orders-of-magnitude less power than a traditional radio. Thereby, the dense deployment of low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a large-scale IoT. In this paper, a WP-BackCom network is modeled as a random Poisson cluster process in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and active ad hoc pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation distances form random clusters centered at PBs. The backscatter nodes can harvest energy from and backscatter carrier signals transmitted by PBs. Furthermore, the transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated PB. Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and transmission capacity are derived and optimized as functions of backscatter parameters, including backscatter duty cycle, reflection coefficient, and the PB density. The effects of the parameters on network performance are quantified.},

abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (BackCom) is faced with the challenge that a single BackCom device can occupy multiple orthogonal resource blocks unintentionally. As a result, in order to avoid co-channel interference, a conventional approach is to serve multiple BackCom devices in different time slots, which reduces both spectral efficiency and connectivity. This letter demonstrates that the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can efficiently improve the system throughput and support massive connectivity in ambient BackCom networks. In particular, two transceiver design approaches are developed in the letter to realize different tradeoffs between system performance and complexity.},

In this paper, we leverage the BM by increasing its down-link (from reader to tag) and up-link (from tag to reader) ranges. We propose two active two-way BM tag configurations, named parallel and series. For both configurations, we use active loads in the tag modulators to maximize the BM range and implement the desired backscattered constellation, subject to no data loss in the down-link path. Contrary to most existing BM studies, we use Thevenin/Norton equivalent circuit, only to calculate the received power at tag, while we derive the tag backscattered power using the antenna scatterer theorem. Moreover, we obtain a closed-form expression of the average bit error probability (BEP) at the reader in Rician fading channel environment for both tag configurations. We compare the proposed active BM tags with the conventional passive BM tags. The simulation results prove that for an average BEP equal to 10-4, an SNR improvement of up to 19 and 24 dB can be achieved for parallel and series configurations, respectively.},

abstract = {A geometric program (GP) is a type of mathematical optimization problem characterized by objective and constraint functions that have a special form. Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale GPs extremely efficiently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit design, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) GPs. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in GP modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an engineering analysis or design problem, in GP format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation. This tutorial paper collects together in one place the basic background material needed to do GP modeling. We start with the basic definitions and facts, and some methods used to transform problems into GP format. We show how to recognize functions and problems compatible with GP, and how to approximate functions or data in a form compatible with GP (when this is possible). We give some simple and representative examples, and also describe some common extensions of GP, along with methods for solving (or approximately solving) them. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

In this paper, we formulate a practical transmission model for an ambient backscatter system, where a tag wishes to send some low-rate messages to a reader with the help of an ambient RF signal source, and then provide fundamental studies of noncoherent symbol detection when all channel state information of the system is unknown. For the first time, a maximum likelihood detector is derived based on the joint probability density function of received signal vectors. In order to ease availability of prior knowledge of the ambient RF signal and reduce computational complexity of the algorithm, we design a joint-energy detector and derive its corresponding detection threshold. The analytical bit error rate (BER) and BER-based outage probability are also obtained in a closed form, which helps with designing system parameters. An estimation method to obtain detection-required parameters and comparison of computational complexity of the detectors are presented as complementary discussions.

To address this challenge, we propose in this letter a new SWIPT system aided by the emerging intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS achieve a high passive beamforming gain, which is appealing for drastically enhancing the WPT efficiency and thereby the R-E trade-off of SWIPT systems. We consider an IRS being deployed to assist a multi-antenna access point (AP) to serve multiple information decoding receivers (IDRs) and energy harvesting receivers (EHRs). We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power received by EHRs via jointly optimizing the transmit precoders at the AP and reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for IDRs. Since this problem is non-convex, we propose efficient algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions for it. In particular, we prove that it is sufficient to send information signals only at the AP to serve both IDRs and EHRs regardless of their channel realizations. Moreover, simulation results show significant performance gains achieved by our proposed designs over benchmark schemes.},

We use this duality result to evaluate the system capacity achievable in a cellular wireless network with multiple antennas at the base station and multiple antennas at each terminal. Some fundamental properties of the rate region are exhibited and algorithms for determining the optimal weighted rate sum and the optimal covariance matrices for achieving a given rate vector on the boundary of the rate region are presented. These algorithms are then used in a simulation study to determine potential capacity enhancements to a cellular system through known-interference cancellation. We study both the circuit data scenario in which each user requires a constant data rate in every frame and the packet data scenario in which users can be assigned a variable rate in each frame so as to maximize the long-term average throughput. In the case of circuit data, the outage probability as a function of the number of active users served at a given rate is determined through simulations. For the packet data case, long-term average throughputs that can be achieved using the proportionally fair scheduling algorithm are determined. We generalized the zero-forcing beamforming technique to the multiple receive antennas case and use this as the baseline for the packet data throughput evaluation.},

While backscatter is low-power and low-cost, it is known to be limitedto short ranges. This paper overturns this conventional wisdom about backscatter and presents the first wide-area backscattersystem. Our design can successfully backscatter from any location between an RF source and receiver, separated by 475 m,while being compatible with commodity LoRa hardware. Further, when our backscatter device is co-located with the RFsource, the receiver can be as far as 2.8 km away. We deploy our system in a 4,800ft2(446m2) house spread across threefloors, a 13,024ft2(1210m2) office area covering 41 rooms, as well as a one-acre (4046m2) vegetable farm and show that wecan achieve reliable coverage, using only a single RF source and receiver. We also build a contact lens prototype as well as aflexible epidermal patch device attached to the human skin. We show that these devices can reliably backscatter data across a3,328ft2(309m2) room. Finally, we present a design sketch of a LoRa backscatter IC that shows that it costs less than a dimeat scale and consumes only 9.25$\mu$W of power, which is more than 1000x lower power than LoRa radio chipsets.},

Recently, a new technique, called symbiotic radio (SR), is proposed to exploit the benefits and address the drawbacks of cognitive radio (CR) and ambient backscattering communications (AmBC), leading to mutualism spectrum sharing and highly reliable backscattering communications. In particular, the secondary transmitter (STx) in SR transmits messages to the secondary receiver (SRx) over the RF signals originating from the primary transmitter (PTx) based on cognitive backscattering communications, thus the secondary system shares not only the radio spectrum, but also the power, and infrastructure with the primary system. In return, the secondary transmission provides beneficial multipath diversity to the primary system, therefore the two systems form mutualism spectrum sharing. More importantly, joint decoding is exploited at SRx to achieve highly reliable backscattering communications. In this article, to exploit the full potential of SR, we provide a systematic view for SR and address three fundamental tasks in SR: (1) enhancing the backscattering link via active load; (2) achieving highly reliable communications through joint decoding; and (3) capturing PTx's RF signals using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.

The definitions of aperture efficiency, absorption efficiency, and the validity of using either a Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit to determine both received and total scattered power are discussed. Circuit circulations and numerical simulations, determining both total received and scattered powers, are presented for a number of antennas, including a straight-wide dipole, a circular loop, a reflector-backed dipole, and a Yagi antenna.

However, the performance of AirComp is bottlenecked by the worst channel condition among all links between the IoT devices and the access point. In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted AirComp system is proposed to boost the received signal power and thus mitigate the performance bottleneck by reconfiguring the propagation channels. With an objective to minimize the AirComp distortion, we propose a joint design of AirComp transceivers and RIS phase-shifts, which however turns out to be a highly intractable non-convex programming problem. To this end, we develop a novel alternating minimization framework in conjunction with the successive convex approximation technique, which is proved to converge monotonically. To reduce the computational complexity, we transform the subproblem in each alternation as a smooth convex-concave saddle point problem, which is then tackled by proposing a Mirror-Prox method that only involves a sequence of closed-form updates. Simulations show that the computation time of the proposed algorithm can be two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving a similar distortion performance.},

As the modulator is usually the most power-hungry block in an RFID tag, this paper proposes a power-saving modulator. The proposed modulator uses phase shift keying (PSK) backscatter modulation which allows tag to communicate data from its memory to a reader by PSK modulation. The proposed modulator uses a MOSCAP as a variable impedance and is designed in a new one-inverter structure in compare to the conventional varactor-based modulators designed in two-inverter structure, as this modulator needs just a low voltage swing to drive its MOSCAP. Using MOSCAP as the variable capacitance leads to a low voltage design. Also, the fundamental equations required for determination of the capacitive impedance seen by the antenna is presented. This impedance is the master key in modulator design. The modulator has been designed, simulated and optimized in 0.18 $\mu$m CMOS technology.

abstract = {Wireless power transfer and backscatter communications have emerged as promising solutions for energizing and communicating with power limited devices. Despite some progress in wirelessly powered backscatter communications, the focus has been on backscatter and energy harvesters (EHs). Recently, significant progress has been made on the design of the transmit multisine waveform, adaptive to the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), in a point-to-point backscatter system. In this paper, we leverage the work and study the design of the transmit multisine waveform in a multiuser backscatter system, made of one transmitter, one reader, and multiple tags active simultaneously. We derive an efficient algorithm to optimize the transmit waveform so as to identify the tradeoff between the amount of energy harvested at the tags and the reliability of the communication, measured in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the reader. The performance with the optimized waveform based on the linear and nonlinear EH models is studied. The numerical results demonstrate the benefits of accounting for the EH nonlinearity, multiuser diversity, frequency diversity, and multisine waveform adaptive to the CSIT to enlarge the SINR-energy region.},

abstract = {Green low power networking with the least requirement of dedicated radio resources is need of the hour which has led to the upsurge of backscatter communication (BSC) technology. However, this inherent potential of BSC is challenged by hardware constraints of the underlying tags. We address this timely concern by investigating the practical efficacy of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology in overcoming the fundamental limitations of BSC. Specifically, we first introduce a novel least-squares based channel estimation (CE) protocol for multi-tag BSC settings that takes care of both the unintended ambient reflections and the inability of tags in performing estimation by themselves. Then using it, a nontrivial low-complexity algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal transceiver designs for the multiantenna reader to maximize the minimum value of the lower-bounded backscattered throughput among the single-antenna semi-passive tags. Additional analytical insights on both individually and jointly-optimal precoding vector and detector matrix at the reader are provided by exploring the asymptotically-optimal transceiver designs. Lastly detailed numerical investigation is carried out to validate the theoretical results and quantify the practically realizable throughput fairness. Specifically, more than seven-fold increase in the common-backscattered-throughput among tags as achieved by the proposed designs over the relevant benchmarks corroborates their practical significance.},

A new co-operative SWIPT NOMA protocol is proposed, in which near NOMA users that are close to the source act as energy harvesting relays to help far NOMA users. Since the locations of users have a significant impact on the performance, three user selection schemes based on the user distances from the base station are proposed. To characterize the performance of the proposed selection schemes, closed-form expressions for the outage probability and system throughput are derived. These analytical results demonstrate that the use of SWIPT will not jeopardize the diversity gain compared to the conventional NOMA.

abstract = {The idea of wireless power transfer (WPT) has been around since the inception of electricity. In the late 19th century, Nikola Tesla described the freedom to transfer energy between two points without the need for a physical connection to a power source as an ?all-surpassing importance to man? [1]. A truly wireless device, capable of being remotely powered, not only allows the obvious freedom of movement but also enables devices to be more compact by removing the necessity of a large battery. Applications could leverage this reduction in size and weight to increase the feasibility of concepts such as paper-thin, flexible displays [2], contact-lens-based augmented reality [3], and smart dust [4], among traditional point-to-point power transfer applications. While several methods of wireless power have been introduced since Tesla?s work, including near-field magnetic resonance and inductive coupling, laser-based optical power transmission, and far-field RF/microwave energy transmission, only RF/microwave and laser-based systems are truly long-range methods. While optical power transmission certainly has merit, its mechanisms are outside of the scope of this article and will not be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Simultaneous information and power transfer over the wireless channels potentially offers great convenience to mobile users. Yet practical receiver designs impose technical constraints on its hardware realization, as practical circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a general receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits the received signal with adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and information decoding, separately. Three special cases of DPS, namely, time switching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting (OPS) are investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of OPS. Moreover, we propose two types of practical receiver architectures, namely, separated versus integrated information and energy receivers. The integrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated receiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for the two architectures are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. The optimal transmission strategy is derived to achieve different rate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption taken into account, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. For the ideal case when the receiver circuit does not consume power, the SPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. In addition, we study the performance for the two types of receivers under a realistic system setup that employs practical modulation. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal practical receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). {\textcopyright} 1972-2012 IEEE.},

Such models are typical in communication systems, where the covariance matrix of the channel vector depends on random parameters, e.g., angles of propagation paths. If the covariance matrices exhibit certain Toeplitz and shift-invariance structures, the complexity of the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator can be reduced to O(M$\backslash$log M) floating point operations, where M is the channel dimension. While in the absence of structure the complexity is much higher, we obtain a similarly efficient (but suboptimal) estimator by using the MMSE estimator of the structured model as a blueprint for the architecture of a neural network. This network learns the MMSE estimator for the unstructured model, but only within the given class of estimators that contains the MMSE estimator for the structured model. Numerical simulations with typical spatial channel models demonstrate the generalization properties of the chosen class of estimators to realistic channel models.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new dynamic IRS beamforming framework to boost the sum throughput of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN). Specifically, the IRS phase-shift vectors across time and resource allocation are jointly optimized to enhance the efficiencies of both downlink wireless power transfer (DL WPT) and uplink wireless information transmission (UL WIT) between a hybrid access point (HAP) and multiple wirelessly powered devices. To this end, we first study three special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming,namely user-adaptive IRS beamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming,by characterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required for UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization framework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number of IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the general problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose two algorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits the intrinsic structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the cases with user-adaptive and static IRS beamforming. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, illustrate the practical significance of IRS with dynamic beamforming for spectral and energy efficient WPCNs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications and design aspects of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the future wireless networks. Conventionally, the network optimization has been limited to transmission control at two endpoints, i.e., end users and network controller. The fading wireless channel is uncontrollable and becomes one of the main limiting factors for performance improvement. The IRS is composed of a large array of scattering elements, which can be individually configured to generate additional phase shifts to the signal reflections. Hence, it can actively control the signal propagation properties in favor of signal reception, and thus realize the notion of a smart radio environment. As such, the IRS's phase control combined with the conventional transmission control can potentially bring performance gain compared to the conventional wireless networks without using the IRS. In this survey, we first introduce basic concepts of the IRS and the realizations of its reconfigurability. Then, we focus on applications of the IRS in wireless communications. We overview different performance metrics and analytical approaches to characterize the performance improvement of IRS-assisted wireless networks. To exploit the performance gain, we discuss the joint optimization of the IRS's phase control and the transceivers' transmission control in different network design problems, e.g., rate maximization and power minimization problems. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of IRS-assisted wireless networks to some emerging wireless applications. Finally, we highlight important practical challenges and future research directions of realizing IRS-assisted wireless communications in beyond 5G networks.},

In that way, more than one carrier transmitters can be distributed in a given geographical area and illuminate a set of RF tags/sensors that modulate and scatter the received carrier towards a single software-defined receiver. The increased number of carrier transmitters and their distributed nature assists tags to be potentially located closer to one carrier transmitter and thus, improves the power of the scattered signals towards the receiver. Specifically, this work a) carefully derives near-optimal detectors for bi-static backscatter radio and on/off keying (OOK) tag modulation (which is widely used in commercial tags), b) analytically calculates their bit error rate (BER) performance, and c) experimentally tests them in practice with a custom bistatic backscatter radio link. As a collateral dividend, it is shown that the non-linear processing of the proposed receivers requires certain attention on the utilized tag design principles, commonly overlooked in the literature, validating recently reported theoretical results on the microwave domain. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we depart from this linear model and design WIPT considering the rectifier nonlinearity. We develop a tractable model of the rectifier nonlinearity that is flexible enough to cope with general multicarrier modulated input waveforms. Leveraging that model, we motivate and introduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition of multicarrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The superposed WIPT waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state information so as to characterize the rate-energy region of the whole system. Analysis and numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived waveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically changes the design of WIPT. We make key and refreshing observations. First, analysis (confirmed by circuit simulations) shows that modulated and unmodulated waveforms are not equally suitable for wireless power delivery, namely, modulation being beneficial in single-carrier transmissions but detrimental in multicarrier transmissions. Second, a multicarrier unmodulated waveform (superposed to a multicarrier modulated waveform) is useful to enlarge the rate-energy region of WIPT. Third, a combination of power splitting and time sharing is in general the best strategy. Fourth, a nonzero mean Gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity-Achieving zero-mean Gaussian input distribution in multicarrier transmissions. Fifth, the rectifier nonlinearity is beneficial to system performance and is essential to efficient WIPT design.},

This textbook takes a unified view of the fundamentals of wireless communication and explains the web of concepts underpinning these advances at a level accessible to an audience with a basic background in probability and digital communication. Topics covered include MIMO (multi-input, multi-output) communication, space-time coding, opportunistic communication, OFDM and CDMA. The concepts are illustrated using many examples from real wireless systems such as GSM, IS-95 (CDMA), IS-856 (1 x EV-DO), Flash OFDM and UWB (ultra-wideband). Particular emphasis is placed on the interplay between concepts and their implementation in real systems. An abundant supply of exercises and figures reinforce the material in the text. This book is intended for use on graduate courses in electrical and computer engineering and will also be of great interest to practising engineers.},

abstract = {Ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) enable wireless communications riding on ambient radio frequency (RF) signals instead of self-generated RF signals. Therefore, it has been considered as a promising candidate for the future Internet-of-Things with stringent energy and spectrum constraints. In this paper, we investigate a full-duplex-enabled cognitive backscatter network, in which an AmBC system underlays a primary cellular system, and the primary access point can transmit primary signals and receive backscatter signals simultaneously via full-duplex communications. We aim to maximize the throughput of the AmBC system while guaranteeing the minimum rate requirements of the primary system via joint time scheduling, transmit power allocation, and reflection coefficient (RC) adjustment. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative method utilizing block coordinated decent to partition the variables into the time scheduling variable and the joint transmit power allocation and RC adjustment variable. For the time scheduling problem, we first prove its convexity and then utilize the interior-point method to solve it. For the joint power allocation and RC adjustment problem, we resort to the concave-convex procedure to transform it into a sequence of convex optimization problems, and then adopt Lagrange dual decomposition to tackle these convex optimization problems. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly increase the throughput of the AmBC system with a fast convergence speed.},

This paper proposes a novel MFSK modulation for the Tag of ambient backscatter communications systems, and the corresponding detectors are designed depending on the capability of the Reader. In the case the Reader is not capable of removing the direct interference from the ambient source, a maximum likelihood detector is proposed. In another case, leveraging on the frequency shift feature of the MFSK modulation, the Reader can remove the direct interference. Then, a simple energy detector is proposed, and the closed-form expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) and outage probability of the system are derived. The findings of this paper suggest that the proposed MFSK modulation outperforms the popular ON-OFF keying modulation, and the impact of modulation order on the SER performance depends heavily on the operating bit signal to noise ratio. Moreover, it is shown that it is desirable to place the Tag close to the Reader in terms of minimizing the outage probability.},

abstract = {This paper considers orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We study the resource allocation algorithm design for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bits/Joule delivered to the receivers). In particular, we focus on power splitting hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting. Two scenarios are investigated considering different power splitting abilities of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can split the received power into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary power splitting ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can split the received power only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed power splitting ratios. For both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm design as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. By exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the non-convex problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and wireless power transfer: (1) wireless power transfer enhances the system energy efficiency by harvesting energy in the radio frequency, especially in the interference limited regime; (2) the presence of multiple receivers is beneficial for the system capacity, but not necessarily for the system energy efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising new solution to provide convenient and perpetual energy supplies to wireless networks. In practice, WPT is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic resonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for short-/mid-/long- range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider the EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry energy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system consisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common transmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from the transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the transmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information rate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we show an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to decode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two practical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and power splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to the outer bound. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal resource allocation algorithm design for large intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. To facilitate efficient system design for large IRSs, instead of jointly optimizing all the IRS elements, we partition the IRS into several tiles and employ a scalable optimization framework comprising an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. In the offline stage, the IRS elements of each tile are jointly designed to support a set of different phase shift configurations, referred to as transmission modes, while the best transmission mode is selected from the set for each tile in the online stage. Given a transmission mode set, we aim to minimize the total base station (BS) transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming and the transmission mode selection policy taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of information decoding and non-linear energy harvesting receivers, respectively. Although the resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, we solve it optimally by applying the branch-and-bound (BnB) approach which entails a high computational complexity. To strike a balance between optimality and computational complexity, we also develop an efficient suboptimal algorithm capitalizing on the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Our simulation results show that the proposed designs enable considerable power savings compared to several baseline schemes. Moreover, our results reveal that by properly adjusting the numbers of tiles and transmission modes, the proposed scalable optimization framework indeed facilitates online design for large IRSs.},

Although IRS-aided WET shares similar characteristics with IRS-aided WIT, they differ fundamentally in terms of design objective, receiver architecture, and practical constraints. In this paper, we provide a tutorial overview on how to efficiently design IRS-aided WET systems as well as IRS-aided systems with both WIT and WET, namely IRS-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and IRS-aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN), mainly from a communication and signal processing perspective.

abstract = {Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is expected to be a technology reshaping the landscape of low-power applications such as the Internet of Things. Multi-antenna multi-sine waveforms adaptive to the channel state information have been shown to be a promising building block of WPT. However, the current design is computationally too complex to be applied to large-scale WPT, where signals are sent across a large number (tens) of antennas and frequencies. This paper proposes efficient single/multi-user algorithms based on a generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit waveforms that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity of the rectenna on the design of waveforms in single/multi-user systems. Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial beamforming, obtained before optimizing power allocation across frequencies, turns out to be maximum ratio transmission. Nevertheless, in the general multi-user weighted-sum criterion maximization problem, optimizations in the frequency and the spatial domains are coupled. Assuming channel hardening, we also propose low-complexity algorithms based on asymptotic analysis, where the structure of the asymptotically optimal spatial beamforming can be found before optimizations. Simulation results confirm the inefficiency of the linear model-based design in single/multi-user systems. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed algorithms (based on the nonlinear model) can benefit from an increasing number of sinewaves at a computational cost much lower than the existing method. Simulation results also indicate that the large-scale WPT architecture can boost the end-to-end power transfer efficiency and the transmission range.},

We show in a measurement-based proof of concept that WPT optimization to nonlinear backscatter transponders is possible solely based on the backscatter signal, without knowledge of the incident power level at the tag or prior knowledge of the tag's characteristics. Using an 8×8 MIMO transceiver array to optimize power delivery, we observed an average WPT enhancement of 8.9 dB relative to an un-optimized 8-transmitter configuration across a 50m3 volume in an office/lab environment. We also show that power to a given tag can be selectively denied, with a notch depth of -106.4 dB (noise floor of the presented measurements). These results are comparable to values previously observed for linear backscatter transponders, and suggest that the use of MIMO interrogators could lead to improved forward-link performance and thus efficiently provide power for sensors or other new power-hungry functions on passive transponders. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Most research efforts to enhance the efficiency of wireless power transfer systems have been confined to the circuit-level design. However, in recent years, attention has been paid to the waveform design for wireless power transmission. It has been found that signals featuring a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) can provide efficiency improvement when compared with CW signals. A number of approaches have been proposed, such as multisines/multicarrier orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) signals, chaotic signals, harmonicsignals, ultrawideband (UWB) signals, intermittent CW (ICW) signals, or white-noise signals. This article reviews these techniques with a focus on multisines/multicarrier signals, harmonic signals, and chaotic signals. A theoretical explanation for efficiency improvement is provided and accompanied by experimental results. Circuit design considerations are presented for the receiver side, and efficient transmission architectures are also described with an emphasis on spatial power combining.},

abstract = {Waveform design is a key technique to jointly exploit a beamforming gain, the channel frequency selectivity, and the rectifier nonlinearity, so as to enhance the end-to-end power transfer efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT). Those waveforms have been designed, assuming perfect channel state information at the transmitter. This paper proposes two waveform strategies relying on limited feedback for multi-antenna multi-sine WPT over frequency-selective channels. In the waveform selection strategy, the energy transmitter (ET) transmits over multiple timeslots with every time a different waveform precoder within a codebook, and the energy receiver (ER) reports the index of the precoder in the codebook that leads to the largest harvested energy. In the waveform refinement strategy, the ET sequentially transmits two waveforms in each stage, and the ER reports one feedback bit indicating an increase/decrease in the harvested energy during this stage. Based on multiple one-bit feedback, the ET successively refines waveform precoders in a tree-structured codebook over multiple stages. By employing the framework of the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, novel algorithms are proposed for both strategies to optimize the codebooks in both space and frequency domains. The proposed limited feedback-based waveform strategies are shown to outperform a set of baselines, achieving higher harvested energy.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionary and transformative technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication cost-effectively in the future. Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each being able to reflect the incident signal independently with an adjustable phase shift so as to collaboratively achieve three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming without the need of any transmit radio-frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided single-cell wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communications between a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate and solve new problems to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming by active antenna array at the AP and reflect beamforming by passive phase shifters at the IRS, subject to users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance of IRS's passive beamforming with infinitely large number of reflecting elements and compare it to that of the traditional active beamforming/relaying. Simulation results demonstrate that an IRS-aided MIMO system can achieve the same rate performance as a benchmark massive MIMO system without using IRS, but with significantly reduced active antennas/RF chains. We also draw useful insights into optimally deploying IRS in future wireless systems.},

abstract = {This paper considers transmit optimization in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channels, wherein we aim at maximizing the secrecy capacity or rate of an MIMO channel overheard by one or multiple eavesdroppers. Such optimization problems are nonconvex, and appear to be difficult especially in the multi-eavesdropper scenario. In this paper, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) approach to tackle these secrecy optimization problems. We first consider the secrecy capacity maximization (SCM) problem in the single eavesdropper scenario. An AO algorithm is derived through a judicious SCM reformulation. The algorithm conducts some kind of reweighting and water-filling in an alternating fashion, and thus is computationally efficient to implement. We also prove that the AO algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the SCM problem. Then, we turn our attention to the multiple eavesdropper scenario, where the artificial noise (AN)-aided secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is considered. Although the AN-aided SRM problem has a more complex problem structure than the previous SCM, we show that AO can be extended to deal with the former, wherein the problem is handled by solving convex problems in an alternating fashion. Again, the resulting AO method is proven to have KKT point convergence guarantee. For fast implementation, a custom-designed AO algorithm based on smoothing and projected gradient is also derived. The secrecy rate performance and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by simulations. {\textcopyright} 1983-2012 IEEE.},

Moreover, many future IoT applications will require the deployment of dense IoT devices, which induces strong interference for wireless information transfer (IT). To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose the design of a novel multiple-access scheme based on time-hopping spread-spectrum (TH-SS) to simultaneously suppress interference and enable both two-way wireless IT and one-way wireless energy transfer (ET) in coexisting backscatter reader-tag links. The performance analysis of the BackCom network is presented, including the bit-error rates for forward and backward IT and the expected energy-transfer rate for forward ET, which account for non-coherent and coherent detection at tags and readers, and energy harvesting at tags, respectively. Our analysis demonstrates a tradeoff between energy harvesting and interference performance. Thus, system parameters need to be chosen carefully to satisfy given BackCom system performance requirement.},

Backscatter communication based on deliberate and ambient sources has the potential to radically alter this paradigm by offering two to three orders of magnitude better communication efficiency (in terms of nJ/Bit) then conventional radio architectures. Initial work on ambient backscatter shows promising results but has focused on narrow band operation in well controlled laboratory settings. The goal of this work is to enable the ubiquitous deployment of ultra-low power nodes that communicate via ambient backscatter to wired Universal Backscatter Readers, in real-world environments. This is accomplished through ultra-wideband backscatter techniques that leverage the breath of commercial broadcast signals in the 80 MHz to 900 MHz range from FM radios, digital TVs, and cellular networks. Additionally the use of powered Universal Backscatter Readers allows a network of ultra-low power nodes to operate on ambient carriers as low as -80 dBm, which is typical for indoor home and office environments. For the first time we demonstrate the simultaneous use of 17 ambient signal sources to achieve node-to-reader communication distances of 50 meters, with data rates up to 1 kbps.},

abstract = {A touchstone for selecting two scattering states for scalar differential backscattering in passive scatterers was introduced by Green in 1963. According to this model, a scatterer has one global minimum and one global maximum scattering states on its $\Gamma$ plane. The variation of radar cross section (RCS) of the scatterer between these two states is monotonic. Thus, to achieve to the highest differential backscattering the scatterer should switch between these two states. In this paper, we verify, by measurements and simulations, that a linear half-wave dipole antenna behaves as predicted by the Green model. However, we show that the RCS of a T-match bow tie antenna over its $\Gamma$ plane cannot be modeled by the Green model and instead the antenna has two maximum scattering states on its $\Gamma$ plane. In the next step, we use dual loading on the T-match bowtie antenna structure. By appropriate selection of the loads, the antenna can provide various scattering states with various magnitudes in 360° phase span in its in-phase and quadrature plane. This feature of the proposed antenna can be used to increase the modulation depth up to 170{\%}, provide a quasi-32-quasi-quadrature amplitude shift keying, and increase the coverage range in backscattering links.},

The optimization problem of maximizing rate-power (RP) region is studied. Assuming that the channel state information (CSI) is available at both the receiver and the transmitter, and constraining to the non-zero mean Gaussian input distributions, an optimization algorithm for power allocation among different subchannels is studied. As a special case, optimality conditions for zero mean Gaussian inputs are derived. Results obtained from the numerical optimization demonstrate the superiority of the non-zero mean Gaussian inputs (with asymmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) in yielding a larger RP region compared to their zero mean and non-zero mean (with symmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) counterparts. The results motivate the design of new modulation for SWIPT and contrast with the SWIPT design under linear energy harvesting, for which the circularly symmetric Gaussian inputs with water-filling power allocation are optimal.},

In this scenario, it is assumed that some users are able to harvest power from radio frequency (RF) signals to recharge batteries through wireless power transfer from the transmitter, while others are served simultaneously with data transmission. The criterion driving the optimization and design of the system is based on the weighted sum rate for the users being served with data. At the same time, constraints stating minimum per-user harvested powers are included in the optimization problem. This paper derives the structure of the optimal transmit covariance matrices in the case where both types of users are present simultaneously in the network, particularizing the results to the cases where either only harvesting nodes or only information users are to be served. The trade-off between the achieved weighted sum rate and the powers harvested by the user terminals is analyzed and evaluated using the rate-power (R-P) region.

abstract = {Space-division multiple access (SDMA) utilizes linear precoding to separate users in the spatial domain and relies on fully treating any residual multi-user interference as noise. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) uses linearly precoded superposition coding with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to superpose users in the power domain and relies on user grouping and ordering to enforce some users to fully decode and cancel interference created by other users. In this paper, we argue that to efficiently cope with the high throughput, heterogeneity of quality of service (QoS), and massive connectivity requirements of future multi-antenna wireless networks, multiple access design needs to depart from those two extreme interference management strategies, namely fully treat interference as noise (as in SDMA) and fully decode interference (as in NOMA). Considering a multiple-input single-output broadcast channel, we develop a novel multiple access framework, called rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA is a more general and more powerful multiple access for downlink multi-antenna systems that contains SDMA and NOMA as special cases. RSMA relies on linearly precoded rate-splitting with SIC to decode part of the interference and treat the remaining part of the interference as noise. This capability of RSMA to partially decode interference and partially treat interference as noise enables to softly bridge the two extremes of fully decoding interference and treating interference as noise and provides room for rate and QoS enhancements and complexity reduction. The three multiple access schemes are compared, and extensive numerical results show that RSMA provides a smooth transition between SDMA and NOMA and outperforms them both in a wide range of network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions, channel strengths, and qualities of channel state information at the transmitter). Moreover, RSMA provides rate and QoS enhancements over NOMA at a lower computational complexity for the transmit scheduler and the receivers (number of SIC layers).},

We show that the optimal transmit strategy employs scalar unit-norm input symbols with arbitrary phase and two beamforming vectors, which are determined as solutions of a non-convex optimization problem. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on a two-dimensional grid search, semidefinite relaxation, and successive convex approximation. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed MIMO WPT design significantly outperforms two baseline schemes based on a linear EH model and a single beamforming vector, respectively. Finally, we show that the average harvested power grows linearly with the number of rectennas at the EH node and saturates for a large number of TX antennas.},

The main challenge of this problem is that the LIM integrated with a large number of low-cost metamaterial antennas can only passively reflect the incident signals by certain phase shifts, and does not have any signal processing capability. To deal with this, we introduce a general framework for the estimation of the transmitter-LIM and LIM-receiver cascaded channel, and propose a two-stage algorithm that includes a sparse matrix factorization stage and a matrix completion stage.

This problem is posed as a joint optimization problem of transmit beamforming and IRS control, whose goal is to maximize the secrecy rate under the total transmission power and unit-modulus constraints.

abstract = {High-efficiency rectennas for radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting have been studied for decades, but most of the literature straightforwardly applies the rectenna aiming at dedicated RF sources to this situation, even though the level of input power is significantly different. Since previous studies address antenna design collecting more ambient RF power, the improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) has emerged in a scattered way, because the theoretical limit of PCE has not yet been characterized, and the optimal rectenna structure approaching such maximum PCE is still uninvestigated. In this paper, we characterize the performance limit of rectennas with input power ranging from -20 to 0 dBm, proposing optimal rectenna design demonstrating the maximum PCE. The maximum achievable PCE is cast into a mathematical programming problem. Solving this optimization model clarifies the effect of design factors, including operational frequencies, rectifier topologies, and parameterization. To achieve the maximum PCE, our investigation shows that the optimal rectenna structure should not only optimize those design factors but also eliminate the matching circuit between an antenna and a rectifier for ultralow-power scenarios. The resultant PCE at 2.45 GHz is 61.4{\%} and 31.8{\%} at -5 and -15 dBm, respectively, closely approaching the theoretical bound.},

Moreover, an accelerated algorithm is designed to improve the convergence speed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed first-order algorithms can achieve almost the same EE as that of second-order approaches yet with much lower computational complexity, which provides insight into the superiority of the proposed algorithms for massive access in cell-free massive MIMO systems.},

In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of a full-duplex multiple-input-multiple-output reader for enhancing the limited communication range of monostatic BSC systems. As this performance is strongly influenced by the channel estimation (CE) quality, we first derive a novel least-squares estimator for the forward and backward links between the reader and the tag, assuming that reciprocity holds and K orthogonal pilots are transmitted from the first K antennas of an N antenna reader. We also obtain the corresponding linear minimum-mean square-error estimate for the backscattered channel. After defining the transceiver design at the reader using these estimates, we jointly optimize the number of orthogonal pilots and energy allocation for the CE and information decoding phases to maximize the average backscattered signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for efficiently decoding the tag's messages. The unimodality of this SNR in optimization variables along with a tight analytical approximation for the jointly global optimal design is also discoursed. Lastly, the selected numerical results validate the proposed analysis, present key insights into the optimal resource utilization at reader, and quantify the achievable gains over the benchmark schemes.},

A practical transmission protocol is proposed to execute channel estimation and passive beamforming successively. To minimize the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation, we first formulate an optimization problem for designing the IRS reflection pattern in the training phase under the constraints of unit-modulus, discrete phase, and full rank. This problem, however, is NP-hard and thus difficult to solve in general. As such, we propose a low-complexity yet efficient method to solve it sub-optimally, by constructing a near-orthogonal reflection pattern based on either discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-matrix quantization or Hadamard-matrix truncation. Based on the estimated channel, we then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable rate by designing the discrete-phase passive beamforming at the IRS with the training overhead and channel estimation error taken into account. To reduce the computational complexity of exhaustive search, we further propose a low-complexity successive refinement algorithm with a properly-designed initialization to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution.

In order to solve the proposed nonconvex optimization problem, we provide an efficient method using semidefinite relaxation. Moreover, for the first time, we characterize the optimal beamforming in a closed form with quasi-degradation condition, which is proven to achieve the same performance as dirty-paper coding (DPC). For the special case with two users, we further show that the original nonconvex TPM problem can be equivalently transferred into a convex optimization problem and easily solved via standard optimization tools. In addition, the optimal beamforming is also characterized in a closed form and we show that it achieves the same performance as the DPC. In the simulation, we show that our proposed optimal NOMA beamforming outperforms OMA schemes and can even achieve the same performance as DPC.

In our WNV framework, an infrastructure provider (InP) owns each base station that is shared by several service providers (SPs) oblivious of each other. The SPs design their precoders as virtualization demands for user services, while the InP designs the actual precoding solution to meet the service demands from the SPs. Our aim is to minimize the long-term time-averaged expected precoding deviation over MIMO fading channels, subject to both per-cell long-term and short-term transmit power limits. We propose an online coordinated precoding algorithm for virtualization, which provides a fully distributed semi-closed-form precoding solution at each cell, based only on the current imperfect CSI without any CSI exchange across cells. Taking into account the two-fold impact of imperfect CSI on both the InP and the SPs, we show that our proposed algorithm is within an {\$}O(\backslashdelta){\$} gap from the optimum over any time horizon, where {\$}\backslashdelta{\$} is a CSI inaccuracy indicator. Simulation results validate the performance of our proposed algorithm under two commonly used precoding techniques in a typical urban micro-cell network environment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of achieving max-min fairness amongst multiple co-channel multicast groups through transmit beamforming. We explicitly focus on overloaded scenarios in which the number of transmitting antennas is insufficient to neutralize all inter-group interference. Such scenarios are becoming increasingly relevant in the light of growing lowlatency content delivery demands, and also commonly appear in multibeam satellite systems. We derive performance limits of classical beamforming strategies using DoF analysis unveiling their limitations; for example, rates saturate in overloaded scenarios due to inter-group interference. To tackle interference, we propose a strategy based on degraded beamforming and successive interference cancellation. While the degraded strategy resolves the rate-saturation issue, this comes at a price of sacrificing all spatial multiplexing gains. This motivates the development of a unifying strategy that combines the benefits of the two previous strategies. We propose a beamforming strategy based on rate-splitting (RS) which divides the messages intended to each group into a degraded part and a designated part, and transmits a superposition of both degraded and designated beamformed streams. The superiority of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through DoF analysis. Finally, we solve the RS beamforming design problem and demonstrate significant performance gains through simulations.},

abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables radio-frequency (RF) powered backscatter devices (BDs) (e.g., sensors, tags) to modulate their information bits over ambient RF carriers in an over-the-air manner. This technology also called "modulation in the air", thus has emerged as a promising solution to achieve green communications for future Internet-of-Things. This paper studies an AmBC system by leveraging the ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulated signals in the air. We first model such AmBC system from a spread-spectrum communication perspective, upon which a novel joint design for BD waveform and receiver detector is proposed. The BD symbol period is designed to be in general an integer multiplication of the OFDM symbol period, and the waveform for BD bit '0' maintains the same state within a BD symbol period, while the waveform for BD bit '1' has a state transition in the middle of each OFDM symbol period within a BD symbol period. In the receiver detector design, we construct the test statistic that cancels out the direct-link interference by exploiting the repeating structure of the ambient OFDM signals due to the use of cyclic prefix. For the system with a single-antenna receiver, the maximum-likelihood detector is proposed to recover the BD bits, for which the optimal threshold is obtained in closed-form expression. For the system with a multi-antenna receiver, we propose a new test statistic which is a linear combination of the per-antenna test statistics, and derive the corresponding optimal detector. The proposed optimal detectors require only knowing the strength of the backscatter channel, thus simplifying their implementation. Moreover, practical timing synchronization algorithms are proposed for the proposed AmBC system, and we also analyze the effect of various system parameters on the transmission rate and detection performance. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to verify that the proposed transceiver design can improve the system bit-error-rate (BER) performance and the operating range significantly, and achieve much higher data rate, as compared to the conventional design.},

These simple modulation schemes transfer data at a rate of one bit per symbol period, which for an integrated CMOS tag IC requires an on-chip oscillator with a frequency at least equal to the bit rate. Motivated by the fact that most modern UHF RFID readers already employ I/Q demodulation of the backscattered signal to account for backscatter phase rotation as the tag moves with respect to the reader, we propose a QAM backscatter method using no on-chip inductors that is compatible with a single-chip CMOS tag implementation.With QAM backscatter, tags transmit more than one data bit per symbol period, permitting tag designers to employ a lower power on-chip oscillator operating at a frequency equal to the (lower) symbol rate while maintaining the same data throughput as ASK or PSK, or alternatively to send data at a higher rate for a given on-chip oscillator frequency. We present the fundamental design equations required for arbitrary QAM backscatter modulators and present simulated bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) curves for the operation of an inductor-free 4-QAM and 8-QAM modulator centered at 915MHz and evaluated over the 860MHz-950MHz worldwide UHF band. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band has been utilized in the IEEE 802.11ad standard to achieve multi-Gbps throughput. Despite the advantages, mmWave links are highly vulnerable to both user and environmental mobility. Since mmWave radios use highly directional antennas, the line-of-sight (LOS) signal can be easily blocked by various obstacles, such as walls, furniture, and humans. In the complicated indoor environment, it is highly possible that the blocked mmWave link cannot be restored no matter how the access point and the mobile user change their antenna directions. To address the problem and enable indoor mobile mmWave networks, in this paper, we introduce the reconfigurable 60 GHz reflect-arrays to establish robust mmWave connections for indoor networks even when the links are blocked by obstructions. First, the reconfigurable 60 GHz reflect-array is designed, implemented, and modeled. Then a three-party beam-searching protocol is designed for reflect-array-assisted 802.11ad networks. Finally, an optimal array deployment strategy is developed to minimize the link outage probability in indoor mobile mmWave networks.

abstract = {In this paper, we study blind channel-and-signal estimation by exploiting the burst-sparse structure of angular-domain propagation channels in massive MIMO systems. The state-of-the-art approach utilizes the structured channel sparsity by sampling the angular-domain channel representation with a uniform angle-sampling grid, a.k.a. virtual channel representation. However, this approach is only applicable to uniform linear arrays and may cause a substantial performance loss due to the mismatch between the virtual representation and the true angle information. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sparse channel representation with a super-resolution sampling grid and a hidden Markovian support. Based on this, we develop a novel approximate inference based blind estimation algorithm to estimate the channel and the user signals simultaneously, with emphasis on the adoption of the expectation-maximization method to learn the angle information. Furthermore, we demonstrate the low-complexity implementation of our algorithm, making use of factor graph and message passing principles to compute the marginal posteriors. Numerical results show that our proposed method significantly reduces the estimation error compared to the state-of-the-art approach under various settings, which verifies the efficiency and robustness of our method.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of IoT driven by recent advancements in consumer electronics, 5G communication technologies, and cloud-computing enabled big-data analytics, has recently attracted tremendous attention from both the industry and academia. One of the major open challenges for IoT is the limited network lifetime due to massive IoT devices being powered by batteries with finite capacities. The low-power and low-complexity backscatter communications (BackCom), which simply relies on passive reflection and modulation of an incident radio-frequency (RF) wave, has emerged to be a promising technology for tackling this challenge. However, the contemporary BackCom has several major limitations, such as short transmission range, low data rate, and uni-directional information transmission. The article aims at introducing the recent advances in the active area of BackCom. Specifically, we provide a systematic introduction of the next generation BackCom covering basic principles, systems, techniques besides IoT applications. Lastly, we describe the IoT application scenarios with the next generation BackCom.},

The rate-energy regions of the WPBC are studied for power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) receivers in a comprehensive way by using the rate and EH functions reflecting the effects of practical systems. For both linear and nonlinear EH models, we analyze the rate-energy regions of the static PS and TS strategies and optimize the dynamic strategies exploiting the channel state information (CSI) to extend the regions. The regions with the static strategies are obtained in closed-form expressions and the dynamic strategies are obtained in explicit forms as a function of a dual variable, by approximating the nonlinear EH model to a piecewise linear EH (PLEH) model. The results show that the dynamic PS and TS strategies outperform their static counterparts and their gains are more prominent in the sensitivity region of a nonlinear EH circuit and with a smaller number of antennas. It is also observed that the dynamic PS strategy provides the best performance but can be replaced by the static one for a large number of antennas to avoid the CSI. The strategies obtained explicitly by using the PLEH model are also shown to work well with a practical EH model without a noticeable loss in the performance.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is envisioned to have abundant applications in future wireless networks by smartly reconfiguring the signal propagation for performance enhancement. Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each reflecting the incident signal with a certain phase shift to collaboratively achieve beamforming and suppress interference at one or more designated receivers. In this paper, we study an IRS-enhanced point-to-point multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to a single-antenna user. As a result, the user simultaneously receives the signal sent directly from the AP as well as that reflected by the IRS. We aim to maximize the total received signal power at the user by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming at the AP and (passive) reflect beamforming by the phase shifters at the IRS. We first propose a centralized algorithm based on the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) by assuming the global channel state information (CSI) available at the IRS. Since the centralized implementation requires excessive channel estimation and signal exchange overheads, we further propose a low-complexity distributed algorithm where the AP and IRS independently adjust the transmit beamforming and the phase shifts in an alternating manner until the convergence is reached. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be achieved by the proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. Moreover, it is verified that the IRS is able to drastically enhance the link quality and/or coverage over the conventional setup without the IRS.},

Instead, a backscatter device leverages a carrier transmitted by an access point or base station. Nevertheless, the traditional approach is to use amplitude shift keying or phase shift keying backscatter solutions which limits the data rate of the sensors, since it transfers only one bit per symbol period. We propose a novel modulator, which employs a Wilkinson power divider with a phase shift in one of the design branch and two transistors acting as switches in order to generate M-quadrature amplitude modulation backscatter modulation.

We propose to use the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), i.e., multiplexing the BNs in different regions or with different backscattered power levels, to enhance the spectrum efficiency of the BackCom system. To better exploit power-domain NOMA, we propose to set the reflection coefficients for multiplexed BNs to be different. Based on this considered model, we develop the reflection coefficient selection criteria. To illustrate the enhanced system with the proposed criteria, we analyze the performance of BackCom system in terms of the average number of bits that can be successfully decoded by the reader for two-node pairing case and the average number of successful BNs for the general multiplexing case. Our results shows that NOMA achieves much better performance gain in the BackCom system as compared to its performance gain in the conventional system, which highlights the importance of applying NOMA to the BackCom system.},

abstract = {Fractional programming (FP) refers to a family of optimization problems that involve ratio term(s). This two-part paper explores the use of FP in the design and optimization of communication systems. Part I of this paper focuses on FP theory and on solving continuous problems. The main theoretical contribution is a novel quadratic transform technique for tackling the multiple-ratio concave-convex FP problem - in contrast to conventional FP techniques that mostly can only deal with the single-ratio or the max-min-ratio case. Multiple-ratio FP problems are important for the optimization of communication networks, because system-level design often involves multiple signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio terms. This paper considers the applications of FP to solving continuous problems in communication system design, particularly for power control, beamforming, and energy efficiency maximization. These application cases illustrate that the proposed quadratic transform can greatly facilitate the optimization involving ratios by recasting the original nonconvex problem as a sequence of convex problems. This FP-based problem reformulation gives rise to an efficient iterative optimization algorithm with provable convergence to a stationary point. The paper further demonstrates close connections between the proposed FP approach and other well-known algorithms in the literature, such as the fixed-point iteration and the weighted minimum mean-square-error beamforming. The optimization of discrete problems is discussed in Part II of this paper.},

MIMO has grown beyond the original point-to-point channel and nowadays refers to a diverse range of centralized and distributed deployments. The fundamental bottleneck toward enormous spectral and energy efficiency benefits in multiuser MIMO networks lies in a huge demand for accurate CSIT. This has become increasingly difficult to satisfy due to the increasing number of antennas and access points in next generation wireless networks relying on dense heterogeneous networks and transmitters equipped with a large number of antennas. CSIT inaccuracy results in a multi-user interference problem that is the primary bottleneck of MIMO wireless networks. Looking backward, the problem has been to strive to apply techniques designed for perfect CSIT to scenarios with imperfect CSIT. In this article, we depart from this conventional approach and introduce readers to a promising strategy based on rate-splitting. Rate-splitting relies on the transmission of common and private messages, and is shown to provide significant benefits in terms of spectral and energy efficiencies, reliability, and CSI feedback overhead reduction over conventional strategies used in LTE-A and exclusively relying on private message transmissions.

abstract = {In this paper, we take a critical and fresh look at the downlink multi-antenna NOMA literature. Instead of contrasting NOMA with OMA, we contrast NOMA with two other baselines. The first is conventional Multi-User Linear Precoding (MULP). The second is Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) based on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) and SIC. We show that there is some confusion about the benefits of NOMA, and we dispel the associated misconceptions. First, we highlight why NOMA is inefficient in multi-antenna settings based on basic multiplexing gain analysis. We stress that the issue lies in how the NOMA literature has been hastily applied to multi-antenna setups, resulting in a misuse of spatial dimensions and therefore loss in multiplexing gains and rate. Second, we show that NOMA incurs a severe multiplexing gain loss despite an increased receiver complexity due to an inefficient use of SIC receivers. Third, we emphasize that much of the merits of NOMA are due to the constant comparison to OMA instead of comparing it to MULP and RS baselines. We then expose the pivotal design constraint that multi-antenna NOMA requires one user to fully decode the messages of the other users. This design constraint is responsible for the multiplexing gain erosion, rate loss, and inefficient use of SIC receivers in multi-antenna settings. Our results confirm that NOMA should not be applied blindly to multi-antenna settings, highlight the scenarios where MULP outperforms NOMA and vice versa, and demonstrate the inefficiency, performance loss and complexity disadvantages of NOMA compared to RS. The first takeaway message is that, while NOMA is not beneficial in most multi-antenna deployments. The second takeaway message is that other non-orthogonal transmission frameworks, such as RS, exist which fully exploit the multiplexing gain and the benefits of SIC to boost the rate in multi-antenna settings.},

In this paper, we consider a backscatter communication network wirelessly powered by a power beacon station (PBS). Each backscatter radio uses the harvested energy to power its data transmissions, in which some other radios can help as the wireless relays with an aim to improve throughput performance by cooperative transmission. Under this setting, we formulate a throughput maximization problem to jointly optimize WPT and the relay strategy of the backscatter radios. An iterative algorithm with reduced complexity and communication overhead is proposed to decompose the original problem into two sub-problems distributed at the PBS and the backscatter receiver. Moreover, we take uncertain channel information into consideration and formulate robust counter-parts of the throughput maximization problem when either the backscatter or relay channel is subject to estimation errors. The difficulty of the robust counter-part lies in the coupling of the PBS' power allocation and relay strategy in matrix inequalities, which is addressed by alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence. Numerical results reveal that the cooperative relay strategy of the backscatter radios significantly improves the throughput performance.},

The RDP constraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under AP and RDP constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an AP constraint, however, depending on the two constraints, it can be either achieved or arbitrarily approached. It is also shown that under AP, PA and RDP constraints, the amplitude of the optimal inputs is discrete with a finite number of mass points. Next, the capacity is studied under AP, PA and output outage probability (OOP) constraints. OOP is modelled as satisfying a certain probability inequality for the amplitude of the received signal being outside of a given interval. Similarly, it is shown that the amplitude of the optimal input is discrete with a finite number of mass points.},

This expression enables us to design an optimal max-min power control scheme that gives equal quality of service to all users. We further compare the performance of the Cell-Free Massive MIMO system to that of a conventional small-cell network and show that the throughput of the Cell-Free system is much more concentrated around its median compared to that of the smallcell system. The Cell-Free Massive MIMO system can provide an almost 20-fold increase in 95{\%}-likely per-user throughput, compared with the small-cell system.

We focus on the user association problem, whose objective is to link each IoT device to an appropriate cellular user by maximizing the sum rate of all IoT devices. However, the difficulty in obtaining the full real-time channel information makes it difficult to design an optimal policy for this problem. To overcome this issue, we propose two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, both use the historical information to infer the current information in order to make appropriate decisions. One algorithm, centralized DRL, makes decisions for all IoT devices at one time with global information. The other algorithm, distributed DRL, makes a decision only for one IoT device at one time using local information. Finally, simulation results show that the two DRL algorithms achieve comparable performance as the optimal user association policy which requires perfect real-time information, and the distributed DRL algorithm has the advantage of scalability.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a new intelligent refracting surface (IRS)-assisted high-mobility communication with the IRS deployed in a high-speed moving vehicle to assist its passenger's communication with a static base station (BS) on the roadside. The vehicle's high Doppler frequency results in a fast fading channel between the BS and the passenger/user, which renders channel estimation for the IRS with a large number of refracting elements a more challenging task as compared to the conventional case with low-mobility users only. In order to mitigate the Doppler effect and reap the full IRS passive beamforming gain with low training overhead, we propose a new and efficient transmission protocol to execute channel estimation and IRS refraction design for data transmission. Specifically, by exploiting the quasi-static channel between the IRS and user both moving at the same high speed, we first estimate the cascaded BS-IRS-user channel with the Doppler effect compensated. Then, we estimate the instantaneous BS-user fast fading channel (without IRS refraction) and tune the IRS refraction over time accordingly to align the cascaded channel with the BS-user direct channel, thus maximizing the IRS's passive beamforming gain as well as converting their combined channel from fast to slow fading. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme and passive beamforming design as compared to various benchmark schemes.},

abstract = {In recent years, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique has been at the center of some of very exciting developments in the area of signal processing and communications, and it has shown great significance and relevance on a variety of applications. Roughly speaking, SDR is a powerful, computationally efficient approximation technique for a host of very difficult optimization problems. In particular, it can be applied to many nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) in an almost mechanical fashion, including the following problem: min x[Rn xTCx s.t. xTFi x {\$} gi, i51,c, p, xTHi x5li, i51,c, q, (1) where the given matrices C, F1,c, Fp, H1,c, Hq are assumed to be general real symmetric matrices, possibly indefinite. The class of nonconvex QCQPs (1) captures many problems that are of interest to the signal processing and communications community. For instance, consider the Boolean quadratic program (BQP) min x[Rn xTCx s.t. xi 2 51, i51,c, n. (2) The BQP is long known to be a computationally difficult problem. In particular, it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, being able to handle the BQP well has an enormous impact on multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) detection and multiuser detection. Another important yet NP-hard problem in the nonconvex QCQP class (1) is min x[Rn xTCx s.t. xTFix {\$} 1, i51,c, m, (3) where C, F1,c, Fm are all positive semidefinite. Problem (3) captures the multicast downlink transmit beamforming problem; see [1] for details. An illustration of an instance of (3) is provided in Figure 1. As seen from the figure, the feasible set of (3) is the intersection of the exteriors of multiple ellipsoids, which makes the problem difficult. As a matter of fact, SDR has been studied and applied in the optimization community long before it made its impact on signal processing and communications. The idea of SDR can be found in an early paper of Lov{\'{a}}sz in 1979 [2], but it was arguably the seminal work of Goemans and Williamson in 1995 [3] that sparked the significant interest in and rapid development of SDR techniques. In that work, it was shown that SDR can be used to provide an approximation accuracy of no worse than 0.8756 for the maximum cut problem (the BQP with some conditions on C). In other words, even though the maximum cut problem is NP-hard, one could efficiently obtain a solution whose objective value is at least 0.8756 times the optimal value using SDR. Since then, we have seen a number of dedicated theoretical analyses that establish the SDR approximation accuracy under different problem settings [3]–[11] and that have greatly improved our understanding of the capabilities of SDR. Today, we are even able to pin down a number of conditions under which SDR provides an exact optimal solution to the original problem [7], [12]–[16].},

The acquisition of the forward-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER) state information (F-CSI) at the ET (or RFID reader) is challenging, since the ERs (or RFID tags) are typically too energy-and-hardware-constrained to estimate or feedback the F-CSI. The ET leverages its observed backscatter signals to estimate the backscatter-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER-to-ET) state information (BS-CSI) directly. We first analyze the harvested energy obtained using the estimated BS-CSI. Furthermore, we optimize the resource allocation to maximize the total utility of harvested energy. For WET to single ER, we obtain the optimal channel-training energy in a semiclosed form. For WET to multiple ERs, we optimize the channel-training energy and the energy allocation weights for different energy beams. For the straightforward weighted-sum-energy (WSE) maximization, the optimal WET scheme is shown to use only one energy beam, which leads to unfairness among ERs and motivates us to consider the complicated proportional-fair-energy (PFE) maximization. For PFE maximization, we show that it is a biconvex problem, and propose a block-coordinate-descent-based algorithm to find the close-to-optimal solution. Numerical results show that with the optimized solutions, the harvested energy suffers slight reduction of less than 10{\%}, compared to that obtained using the perfect F-CSI.},

Considering the nonlinearity of practical energy harvesting circuits, we adopt the realistic nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) model rather than the idealistic linear EH model. To characterize the optimal rate-energy (RE) tradeoff, we consider the problem of maximizing the R-E region, which is nonconvex. We solve this challenging problem for two different cases of the channel state information (CSI): (i) when the CSI is known only at the receiver (the CSIR case) and (ii) when the CSI is known at both the transmitter and the receiver (the CSI case). For these two cases, we develop the corresponding optimal dynamic power splitting schemes. To address the complexity issue, we also propose the suboptimal schemes with low complexities. Comparing the proposed schemes to the existing schemes, we provide various useful and interesting insights into the dynamic power splitting for the nonlinear EH. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the scenarios of the partial CSI at the transmitter and the harvested energy maximization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly outperform the existing schemes and the proposed suboptimal scheme works very close to the optimal scheme at a much lower complexity.},

abstract = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a new frequency domain non-orthogonal multiple-access technique which can improve spectral efficiency of wireless radio access. With SCMA, different incoming data streams are directly mapped to codewords of different multi-dimensional cookbooks, where each codeword represents a spread transmission layer. Multiple SCMA layers share the same time-frequency resources of OFDMA. The sparsity of codewords makes the near-optimal detection feasible through iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). Such low complexity of multi-layer detection allows excessive codeword overloading in which the dimension of multiplexed layers exceeds the dimension of codewords. Optimization of overloading factor along with modulation-coding levels of layers provides a more flexible and efficient link-adaptation mechanism. On the other hand, the signal spreading feature of SCMA can improve link-adaptation as a result of less colored interference. In this paper a technique is developed to enable multi-user SCMA (MU-SCMA) for downlink wireless access. User pairing, power sharing, rate adjustment, and scheduling algorithms are designed to improve the downlink throughput of a heavily loaded network. The advantage of SCMA spreading for lightly loaded networks is also evaluated.},

abstract = {RF harvesting circuits have been demonstrated for more than 50 years, but only a few have been able to harvest energy from freely available ambient (i.e., non-dedicated) RF sources. In this paper, our objectives were to realize harvester operation at typical ambient RF power levels found within urban and semi-urban environments. To explore the potential for ambient RF energy harvesting, a city-wide RF spectral survey was undertaken from outside all of the 270 London Underground stations at street level. Using the results from this survey, four harvesters (comprising antenna, impedance-matching network, rectifier, maximum power point tracking interface, and storage element) were designed to cover four frequency bands from the largest RF contributors (DTV, GSM900, GSM1800, and 3G) within the ultrahigh frequency (0.3-3 GHz) part of the frequency spectrum. Prototypes were designed and fabricated for each band. The overall end-to-end efficiency of the prototypes using realistic input RF power sources is measured; with our first GSM900 prototype giving an efficiency of 40{\%}. Approximately half of the London Underground stations were found to be suitable locations for harvesting ambient RF energy using our four prototypes. Furthermore, multiband array architectures were designed and fabricated to provide a broader freedom of operation. Finally, an output dc power density comparison was made between all the ambient RF energy harvesters, as well as alternative energy harvesting technologies, and for the first time, it is shown that ambient RF harvesting can be competitive with the other technologies.{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {This two-part paper develops novel methodologies for using fractional programming (FP) techniques to design and optimize communication systems. Part I of this paper proposes a new quadratic transform for FP and treats its application for continuous optimization problems. In this Part II of the paper, we study discrete problems, such as those involving user scheduling, which are considerably more difficult to solve. Unlike the continuous problems, discrete or mixed discrete-continuous problems normally cannot be recast as convex problems. In contrast to the common heuristic of relaxing the discrete variables, this work reformulates the original problem in an FP form amenable to distributed combinatorial optimization. The paper illustrates this methodology by tackling the important and challenging problem of uplink coordinated multi-cell user scheduling in wireless cellular systems. Uplink scheduling is more challenging than downlink scheduling, because uplink user scheduling decisions significantly affect the interference pattern in nearby cells. Further, the discrete scheduling variable needs to be optimized jointly with continuous variables such as transmit power levels and beamformers. The main idea of the proposed FP approach is to decouple the interaction among the interfering links, thereby permitting a distributed and joint optimization of the discrete and continuous variables with provable convergence. The paper shows that the well-known weighted minimum meansquare-error (WMMSE) algorithm can also be derived from a particular use of FP; but our proposed FP-based method significantly outperforms WMMSE when discrete user scheduling variables are involved, both in term of run-time efficiency and optimizing results.},

Our goal Is to maximize the sum rate of the backscatter data rate and the transmission rate during the IT phase by jointly optimizing power allocation, time allocation, reflection coefficient, energy allocation coefficient, where the maximum transmit power constraint at the PS and the minimum circuit power consumption constraint are considered. Then an Iterative RA algorithm Is developed to find the optimal solutions. Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme In terms of transmission rates.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a novel research direction that leverages vision to help overcome the critical wireless communication challenges. In particular, this paper considers millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, which are principal components of 5G and beyond. These systems face two important challenges: (i) the large training overhead associated with selecting the optimal beam and (ii) the reliability challenge due to the high sensitivity to link blockages. Interestingly, most of the devices that employ mmWave arrays will likely also use cameras, such as 5G phones, self-driving vehicles, and virtual/augmented reality headsets. Therefore, we investigate the potential gains of employing cameras at the mmWave base stations and leveraging their visual data to help overcome the beam selection and blockage prediction challenges. To do that, this paper exploits computer vision and deep learning tools to predict mmWave beams and blockages directly from the camera RGB images and the sub-6GHz channels. The experimental results reveal interesting insights into the effectiveness of such solutions. For example, the deep learning model is capable of achieving over 90$\backslash${\%} beam prediction accuracy, which only requires snapping a shot of the scene and zero overhead.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a probabilistically robust transmit optimization problem under imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and under the multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink scenario. The main issue is to keep the probability of each user's achievable rate outage as caused by CSI uncertainties below a given threshold. As is well known, such rate outage constraints present a significant analytical and computational challenge. Indeed, they do not admit simple closed-form expressions and are unlikely to be efficiently computable in general. Assuming Gaussian CSI uncertainties, we first review a traditional robust optimization-based method for approximating the rate outage constraints, and then develop two novel approximation methods using probabilistic techniques. Interestingly, these three methods can be viewed as implementing different tractable analytic upper bounds on the tail probability of a complex Gaussian quadratic form, and they provide convex restrictions, or safe tractable approximations, of the original rate outage constraints. In particular, a feasible solution from any one of these methods will automatically satisfy the rate outage constraints, and all three methods involve convex conic programs that can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf solvers. We then proceed to study the performance-complexity tradeoffs of these methods through computational complexity and comparative approximation performance analyses. Finally, simulation results are provided to benchmark the three convex restriction methods against the state of the art in the literature. The results show that all three methods offer significantly improved solution quality and much lower complexity.},

In this paper, we propose a distributed intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) system, where IRSs are exploited to enhance the mmWave signal coverage when direct links between base station and users are unavailable. First, a joint active and passive beamforming problem is established for weighted sum-rate maximization.

To this end, we adopt a physics-based IRS model that, unlike the conventional IRS model, takes into account the impact of the incident and reflection angles of the impinging electromagnetic wave on the reflected signal. To facilitate efficient resource allocation design for large IRSs, we employ a scalable optimization framework, where the IRS is partitioned into several tiles and the phase shift elements of each tile are jointly designed to realize different transmission modes. Then, the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the transmission mode selection of the tiles of the IRS are jointly optimized for minimization of the BS transmit power taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of both non-linear energy harvesting receivers and information decoding receivers. For handling the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we apply a penalty-based method, successive convex approximation, and semidefinite relaxation to develop a computationally efficient algorithm which asymptotically converges to a locally optimal solution of the considered problem. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme enables considerable power savings compared to two baseline schemes. Moreover, our results also illustrate that the advocated physics-based model and scalable optimization framework for large IRSs allows us to strike a balance between system performance and computational complexity, which is vital for realizing large IRS-assisted communication systems.},

All proposed techniques are based on simple, but careful, switching frequency control at the tag, allowing for the easy frequency-domain multiple access. First, a digital modulation scheme is offered, namely pseudo-frequency shift keying, assuming illumination from constant envelope-modulated signals and a fully coherent detector is derived along with closed-form probability of error. A second digital modulation scheme is also offered, based on a frequency-shifted form of binary phase shift keying (S-BPSK), relaxing the constant-envelope requirement for the illuminator and an illumination-agnostic detector is derived. Based on S-BPSK, short packet error correction coding is utilized for ambient backscatter communication, for the first time in the literature. It is shown that the proposed coded scheme under modulated ambient signal illumination {\&} wireless channel variation, offers tremendous performance gains, i.e., modulation of the ambient signal is helpful. Finally, a third, purely analog, modulation scheme is analyzed, based on FM remodulation principles. A low-cost tag is implemented, demonstrating tag-toreceiver ranges up to 26 meters outdoors, power consumption of 24 $\mu$Watts in continuous operation, able to be interrogated by any conventional frequency modulation (FM) receiver. The proposed techniques cover a large variety of omnipresent wireless industry systems, enabling universal ambient backscatter and relevant wireless information and power transfer (WIPT) applications.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technique to enhance the wireless communication spectral efficiency with low hardware and energy cost. In this letter, we consider the integration of IRS to an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiuser downlink communication system, and study the pertinent joint optimization of the IRS reflection coefficients and OFDMA time-frequency resource block as well as power allocations to maximize the users' common (minimum) rate. Specifically, due to the lack of frequency-selective passive beamforming capability at the IRS, only one set of reflection coefficients can be designed for adapting to a large number of channels of multiple users over different frequency sub-bands. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS reflection coefficients are dynamically adjusted over different time slots within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying channels and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time slot, thus achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system common rate over the setup without IRS and that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic passive beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a common set of reflection coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more flexibly balancing between passive beamforming and multiuser diversity gains.},

abstract = {When simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is carried out, a fundamental tradeoff between achievable rate and harvested energy exists because the received power is used for two different purposes. The tradeoff is well characterized by the rate-energy region, and several techniques have been proposed to improve the achievable rate-energy region. However, the existing techniques still have a considerable loss in either energy or rate and thus the known achievable rate-energy regions are far from the ideal one. Deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the rate-energy region of our proposed scheme, we prove that the rate-energy region can be expanded almost to the ideal upper bound. Contrary to the existing techniques, in the proposed scheme, the information decoding circuit not only extracts amplitude and phase information but also combines the extracted information with the amplitude information obtained from the rectified signal. Consequently, the required energy for decoding can be minimized, and thus the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal rate-energy region, which implies that the fundamental tradeoff in the achievable rate-energy region is nearly eliminated. To practically account for the theoretically achievable rate-energy region, we also present practical examples with an M -ary multi-level circular QAM with Gaussian maximum likelihood detection.},

On the one hand, a reconfigurable intelligent surface improves the network performance by adding electronically controlled reflected paths in the radio propagation channel. On the other hand, in an ambient backscatter system, a device, named tag, communicates towards a reader by backscattering the waves of an ambient source (such as a TV tower). However, the tag's backscattered signal is weak and strongly interfered by the direct signal from the ambient source. In this paper, we propose a new reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted ambient backscatter system. The proposed surface allows to control the reflection of an incident wave coming from the exact source location towards the tag and reader locations (creating hot spots at their locations), thanks to passive reflected beams from a predefined codebook. A common phase-shift can also be applied to the beam. Thanks to these features, we demonstrate experimentally that the performance of ambient backscatter communications can be significantly improved.},

As a result, backscatter has become an attractive design choice for short-range communications in power constrained wireless sensor networking scenarios. The purpose of this work is two-fold. First, it aims to expose backscatter communication as an emerging topic to a communication systems-theoretic audience. Since backscatter modulation and on-tag power harvesting efficiency are coupled, it is necessary to re-examine notions of power and spectral efficiency from an energy-constraint perspective; this leads to novel coded modulation schemes for future RFID systems. Further, we investigate RFID MIMO systems where the channel fading encountered has different statistics than the classical Rayleigh fading model. In turn,the trade off between diversity order and spatial multiplexing gains are distinct from wide-area MIMO. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The novel concept of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is investigated, where the incident wireless signal is divided into transmitted and reflected signals passing into both sides of the space surrounding the surface, thus facilitating a full-space manipulation of signal propagation. Based on the introduced basic signal model of `STAR', three practical operating protocols for STAR-RISs are proposed, namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS). Moreover, a STAR-RIS aided downlink communication system is considered for both unicast and multicast transmission, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) sends information to two users, i.e., one on each side of the STAR-RIS. A power consumption minimization problem for the joint optimization of the active beamforming at the BS and the passive transmission and reflection beamforming at the STAR-RIS is formulated for each of the proposed operating protocols, subject to communication rate constraints of the users. For ES, the resulting highly-coupled non-convex optimization problem is solved by an iterative algorithm, which exploits the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Then, the proposed penalty-based iterative algorithm is extended to solve the mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem for MS. For TS, the optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems, which can be consecutively solved using state-of-the-art algorithms and convex optimization techniques. Finally, our numerical results reveal that: 1) the TS and ES operating protocols are generally preferable for unicast and multicast transmission, respectively; and 2) the required power consumption for both scenarios is significantly reduced by employing the proposed STAR-RIS instead of conventional reflecting/transmiting-only RISs.},

abstract = {Sensor collision (interference) is studied in a large network of low bit-rate sensors that communicate via backscatter, i.e. modulate the reflection of a common carrier transmitted by a central reader. Closed-form analysis is provided, quantifying sensor collision (interference) in high-density, backscatter sensor networks (BSN), as a function of number of tags and aggregate bandwidth. Analysis is applicable to a broad class of sensor subcarrier modulations, propagation environments and reader antenna directivity patterns. It is discovered that anti-collision performance in high-density backscatter sensor networks is feasible provided that appropriate modulation is used at each sensor. That is due to the round-trip nature of backscatter communication as well as the extended target range, which both impose stringent requirements on spectrum efficiency, not easily met by all modulations. Furthermore, aggregate bandwidth savings for given anti-collision performance are quantified, when simple division techniques on subcarrier (modulating) frequency and space (via moderately directive hub antenna) are combined. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {While fifth-generation (5G) communications are being rolled out worldwide, sixth-generation (6G) communications have attracted much attention from both the industry and the academia. Compared with 5G, 6G will have a wider frequency band, higher transmission rate, spectrum efficiency, greater connection capacity, shorter delay, broader coverage, and more robust anti-interference capability to satisfy various network requirements. This survey presents an insightful understanding of 6G wireless communications by introducing requirements, features, critical technologies, challenges, and applications. First, we give an overview of 6G from perspectives of technologies, security and privacy, and applications. Subsequently, we introduce various 6G technologies and their existing challenges in detail, e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent surfaces, THz, space-air-ground-sea integrated network, cell-free massive MIMO, etc. Because of these technologies, 6G is expected to outperform existing wireless communication systems regarding the transmission rate, latency, global coverage, etc. Next, we discuss security and privacy techniques that can be applied to protect data in 6G. Since edge devices are expected to gain popularity soon, the vast amount of generated data and frequent data exchange make the leakage of data easily. Finally, we predict real-world applications built on the technologies and features of 6G; for example, smart healthcare, smart city, and smart manufacturing will be implemented by taking advantage of AI.},

TOPS can be used with arbitrary shaped one-dimensional (1-D) or two-dimensional (2-D) arrays. Unlike other coherent wideband methods, such as the coherent signal subspace method (CSSM) and WAVES, the new method does not require any preprocessing for initial values. The performance of those wideband techniques and incoherent MUSIC is compared with that of the new method through computer simulations. The simulations show that this new technique performs better than others in mid signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges, while coherent methods work best in low SNR and incoherent methods work best in high SNR.

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new paradigm to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless networks by reconfiguring the wireless signal propagation via passive reflection. To reap the promising gains of IRS, channel state information (CSI) is essential, whereas channel estimation errors are inevitable in practice due to limited channel training resources. In this paper, in order to optimize the performance of IRS-aided multiuser communications with imperfect CSI, we propose to jointly design the active transmit precoding at the access point (AP) and passive reflection coefficients of the IRS, each consisting of not only the conventional phase shift and also the newly exploited amplitude variation. First, the achievable rate of each user is derived assuming a practical IRS channel estimation method, which shows that the interference due to CSI errors is intricately related to the AP transmit precoders, the channel training power and the IRS reflection coefficients during both channel training and data transmission. Next, for the single-user case, by combining the benefits of the penalty method, Dinkelbach method and block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method, a new penalized Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm is proposed to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients for maximizing the achievable data transmission rate subjected to CSI errors; while for the multiuser case, a new penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the users{\&}{\#}x2019; weighted sum-rate. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. In particular, useful insights are drawn to characterize the effect of IRS reflection amplitude control (with/without the conventional phase-shift control) on the system performance under imperfect CSI.},

abstract = {Transmission through reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which control the reflection/scattering characteristics of incident waves in a deliberate manner to enhance the signal quality at the receiver, appears as a promising candidate for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we bring the concept of RIS-assisted communications to the realm of index modulation (IM) by proposing RIS-space shift keying (RIS-SSK) and RIS-spatial modulation (RIS-SM) schemes. These two schemes are realized through not only intelligent reflection of the incoming signals to improve the reception but also utilization of the IM principle for the indices of multiple receive antennas in a clever way to improve the spectral efficiency. Maximum energy-based suboptimal (greedy) and exhaustive search-based optimal (maximum likelihood) detectors of the proposed RIS-SSK/SM schemes are formulated and a unified framework is presented for the derivation of their theoretical average bit error probability. Extensive computer simulation results are provided to assess the potential of RIS-assisted IM schemes as well as to verify our theoretical derivations. Our findings also reveal that RIS-based IM, which enables high data rates with remarkably low error rates, can become a potential candidate for future wireless communication systems in the context of beyond multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) solutions.},

The number of AP antennas is significantly larger than the number of users. The system is not partitioned into cells and each user is served by all APs simultaneously. The simplest linear precoding schemes are conjugate beamforming and zero-forcing. Max-min power control provides equal throughput to all users and is considered in this paper. Surprisingly, under max-min power control, most APs are found to transmit at less than full power. The zero-forcing precoder significantly outperforms conjugate beamforming. For zero-forcing, a near-optimal power control algorithm is developed that is considerably simpler than exact max-min power control. An alternative to cell-free systems is small-cell operation in which each user is served by only one AP for which power optimization algorithms are also developed. Cell-free Massive MIMO is shown to provide five-to ten-fold improvement in 95{\%}-likely per-user throughput over small-cell operation.},

The MIMO SWIPT design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem in which system sum rate is optimized considering per-user harvesting constraints. Two different approaches are proposed. The first approach is based on a classical gradient-based method for constrained optimization. The second approach is based on difference of convex (DC) programming. The idea behind this approach is to obtain a convex function that approximates the nonconvex objective and, then, solve a series of convex subproblems that, eventually, will provide a (locally) optimum solution of the general nonconvex problem. The solution obtained from the proposed approach is compared to the classical block-diagonalization (BD) strategy, typically used to solve the nonconvex multiuser MIMO network by forcing no inter-user interference. Simulation results show that the proposed approach improves both the system sum rate and the power harvested by users simultaneously. In terms of computational time, the proposed DC programming outperforms the classical gradient methods.},

Contrary to the conventional linear precoding (NoRS) that relies on fully treating any residual interference as noise, we consider a novel multigroup multicast beamforming strategy based on RSMA. RSMA relies on linearly precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers, and has recently been shown to enable a flexible framework for non-orthogonal transmission and robust interference management in multi-antenna wireless networks. In this work, we characterize the MMF Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) achieved by RS and NoRS in multigroup multicast with imperfect CSIT and demonstrate the benefits of RS strategies for both underloaded and overloaded scenarios. Motivated by the DoF analysis, we then formulate a generic transmit power constrained optimization problem to achieve MMF rate performance. The superiority of RS-based multigroup multicast beamforming compared with NoRS is demonstrated via simulations in both terrestrial and multibeam satellite systems. In particular, due to the characteristics and challenges of multibeam satellite communications, our proposed RS strategy is shown promising to manage its inter-beam interference.},

Motivated by applications, such as single-molecule imaging, radar imaging, etc., we consider parameter estimation of complex exponentials from their modulations with unknown waveforms, allowing for non-stationary blind super-resolution. This problem, however, is ill-posed since both the parameters associated with the complex exponentials and the modulating waveforms are unknown. To alleviate this, we assume that the unknown waveforms live in a common low-dimensional subspace. Using a lifting trick, we recast the blind super-resolution problem as a structured low-rank matrix recovery problem. Atomic norm minimization is then used to enforce the structured low-rankness, and is reformulated as a semidefinite program that is solvable in polynomial time. We show that, up to scaling ambiguities, exact recovery of both of the complex exponential parameters and the unknown waveforms is possible when the waveform subspace is random and the number of measurements is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the problem. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings, showing that non-stationary blind super-resolution using atomic norm minimization is possible.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have found numerous applications and are expected to bring fertile business opportunities in the next decade. Among various enabling technologies for UAVs, wireless communication is essential and has drawn significantly growing attention in recent years. Compared to the conventional terrestrial communications, UAVs' communications face new challenges due to their high altitude above the ground and great flexibility of movement in the 3-D space. Several critical issues arise, including the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant UAV-ground channels and induced strong aerial-terrestrial network interference, the distinct communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for UAV control messages versus payload data, the stringent constraints imposed by the size, weight, and power (SWAP) limitations of UAVs, as well as the exploitation of the new design degree of freedom (DoF) brought by the highly controllable 3-D UAV mobility. In this article, we give a tutorial overview of the recent advances in UAV communications to address the above issues, with an emphasis on how to integrate UAVs into the forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) and future cellular networks. In particular, we partition our discussion into two promising research and application frameworks of UAV communications, namely UAV-assisted wireless communications and cellular-connected UAVs, where UAVs are integrated into the network as new aerial communication platforms and users, respectively. Furthermore, we point out promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {This paper formulates and solves optimization problems whose objective is to maximize the sum-Throughput of wireless sensor networks with radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) and backscatter communication. The paper proposes and analyzes three protocols for maximizing the sum-Throughput; namely, the time-division with downlink data decoding protocol, hybrid power splitting/data decoding protocol, and backscatter-enabled combination protocol. The time-division protocol optimizes a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) with a two-way communication link between the sensors and a hybrid access point. The hybrid protocol optimizes a WPCN with a power splitting downlink data decoding phase. The backscattered-enabled combination protocol optimizes a WPCN with a power splitting downlink data decoding phase and backscatter communication enabled sensors. Numerical results show that the hybrid and combination protocols deliver up to 14.5{\%} and 30.5{\%} increase in sum-Throughput, respectively, compared with the reference time-switching RF EH protocol in a dynamic environment. The findings are significant for the future widespread adoption of WPCN systems powered by RF energy sources in the real world by increasing the amount of harvested energy and system achievable data rate.},

abstract = {In this paper, a design method for the co-design and integration of a CMOS rectifier and small loop antenna is described. In order to improve the sensitivity, the antenna-rectifier interface is analyzed as it plays a crucial role in the co-design optimization. Subsequently, a 5-stage cross-connected differential rectifier with a 7-bit binary-weighted capacitor bank is designed and fabricated in standard 90 nm CMOS technology. The rectifier is brought at resonance with a high-Q loop antenna by means of a control loop that compensates for any variation at the antenna-rectifier interface and passively boosts the antenna voltage to enhance the sensitivity. A complementary MOS diode is proposed to improve the harvester's ability to store and hold energy over a long period of time during which there is insufficient power for rectification. The chip is ESD protected and integrated on a compact loop antenna. Measurements in an anechoic chamber at 868 MHz demonstrate a-27 dBm sensitivity for 1 V output across a capacitive load and 27 meter range for a 1.78 W RF source in an office corridor.

In this system, a multi-antenna access point (AP) uses transmit beamforming to send both information and energy signals to a set of receivers each for information decoding (ID) or energy harvesting (EH), and a dedicatedly deployed IRS properly controls its reflecting phase shifts to form passive reflection beams for facilitating both ID and EH at receivers. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the (active) information and energy transmit beamforming at the AP together with the (passive) reflective beamforming at the IRS, to maximize the minimum power received at all EH receivers, subject to individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at ID receivers, and the maximum transmit power constraint at the AP. Although the formulated SINR-constrained min-energy maximization problem is highly non-convex, we present an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution by using the techniques of alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results show that the proposed IRS-assisted SWIPT system with both information and energy signals achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes without IRS deployed and/or without dedicated energy signals used.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of wireless applications, the electromagnetic (EM) space is becoming more and more crowded and complex. This makes it a challenging task to accommodate the growing number of radio systems with limited radio resources. In this paper, by considering the EM space as a radio ecosystem, and leveraging the analogy to the natural ecosystem in biology, a novel symbiotic communication (SC) paradigm is proposed through which the relevant radio systems, called symbiotic radios (SRs), in a radio ecosystem form a symbiotic relationship (e.g., mutualistic symbiosis) through intelligent resource/service exchange. Radio resources include, e.g., spectrum, energy, and infrastructure, while typical radio services are communicating, relaying, and computing. The symbiotic relationship can be realized via either symbiotic coevolution or symbiotic synthesis. In symbiotic coevolution, each SR is empowered with an evolutionary cycle alongside the multi-agent learning, while in symbiotic synthesis, the SRs ingeniously optimize their operating parameters and transmission protocols by solving a multi-objective optimization problem. Promisingly, the proposed SC paradigm breaks the boundary of radio systems, thus providing us a fresh perspective on radio resource management and new guidelines to design future wireless communication systems.},

An atomic norm minimization approach is proposed to exactly recover the unobserved samples and identify the unknown frequencies, which is then reformulated as an exact semidefinite program.

abstract = {Ambient backscatter communications have emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable development of the Internet of Things (IoT). In such system, a radio frequency (RF) tag can transmit data to a receiver without battery and without generating any new RF wave, just by backscattering the incident RF wave originated by an ambient RF source. The simplest tag is a dipole that is either in an absorbing mode or in reflecting mode to send "0" or "1", and thus leads to a modulation order of 2. Previous solutions to reach higher modulation order, so as to achieve higher data rate, are based on antenna arrays. However, such solutions are not suitable for connected objects, due to their sizes. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a new tag that uses a compact antenna with reconfigurable radiation patterns to provide a high modulation order. We present experimental bit error rate measurements obtained with an experimental test-bed and two tag antennas, both providing 4 states and thus being able to convey 2 bits per symbol. These measurements show that the performance improves with increasing number of receive antennas, and lead to the conclusion that a tag antenna with low cross-correlations between reconfigurable radiation patterns is suitable for backscattering applications in IoT.},

abstract = {A new line of research on communications and signals design for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has recently emerged in the communication literature. Promising signal strategies to maximize the power transfer efficiency of WPT rely on (energy) beamforming, waveform, modulation and transmit diversity, and a combination thereof. To a great extent, the study of those strategies has so far been limited to theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we study the real over-the-air performance of all the aforementioned signal strategies for WPT. To that end, we have designed, prototyped and experimented an innovative radiative WPT architecture based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR) that can operate in open-loop and closed-loop (with channel acquisition at the transmitter) modes. The prototype consists of three important blocks, namely the channel estimator, the signal generator, and the energy harvester. The experiments have been conducted in a variety of deployments, including frequency flat and frequency selective channels, under static and mobility conditions. Experiments highlight that a channeladaptive WPT architecture based on joint beamforming and waveform design offers significant performance improvements in harvested DC power over conventional single-antenna/multiantenna continuous wave systems. The experimental results fully validate the observations predicted from the theoretical signal designs and confirm the crucial and beneficial role played by the energy harvester nonlinearity.},

As a result, conventional wireless devices can receive these backscattered signals without any modification (neither hardware nor software) to the conventional wireless device. We present a proof of concept using the Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy, or BLE, standard widely available on smart phones and mobile devices. Our prototype backscatter tag produces three-channel bandpass frequency shift keying (FSK) packets at 1 Mbps that are indistinguishable from conventional BLE advertising packets. An unmodified Apple iPad is shown to correctly receive and display these packets at a range of over 9.4 m using its existing iOS Bluetooth stack with no changes whatsoever. We create all three BLE channels by backscattering a single incident CW carrier using a novel combination of fundamentalmode and harmonic-mode backscatter subcarrier modulation, with two of the band-pass channels generated by the fundamental mode and one of the band-pass channels generated by the second harmonic mode. The backscatter modulator consumes only 28.4 pJ/bit, compared with over 10 nJ/bit for conventional BLE transmitters. The backscatter approach yields over 100X lower energy per bit than a conventional BLE transmitter, while retaining compatibility with billions of existing Bluetooth enabled smartphones and mobile devices.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the approximation algorithms for a class of discrete quadratic optimization problems in the Hermitian complex form. A special case of the problem that we study corresponds to the max-3-cut model used in a recent paper of Goemans and Williamson [J. Comput. System Sci., 68 (2004), pp. 442-470]. We first develop a closed-form formula to compute the probability of a complex-valued normally distributed bivariate random vector to be in a given angular region. This formula allows us to compute the expected value of a randomized (with a specific rounding rule) solution based on the optimal solution of the complex semidefinite programming relaxation problem. In particular, we present an {m2(1 -cos 2$\pi$/m)/87$\pi$]-approximation algorithm, and then study the limit of that model, in which the problem remains NP-hard. We show that if the objective is to maximize a positive semidefinite Hermitian form, then the randomization-rounding procedure guarantees a worst-case performance ratio of $\pi$/4 ≈ 0.7854, which is better than the ratio of 2/$\pi$ ≈ 0.6366 for its counterpart in the real case due to Nesterov. Furthermore, if the objective matrix is real-valued positive semidefinite with nonpositive off-diagonal elements, then the performance ratio improves to 0.9349. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.}},

The NOMA beamforming design is formulated as a weighted sum rate maximization (WSRM) problem with decoding order constraints on the beamforming vectors and quality-of-service constraints for each user. We first investigate the feasibility of the NOMA WSRM problem and then propose an efficient method to achieve the optimized beamforming vectors. Furthermore, we consider the situation where user channels are homogeneous, which is particularly suitable for using NOMA. In this case, we show that the NOMA WSRM beamforming problem admits the favorable convexity and thus the optimal beamforming solution can be efficiently found.

abstract = {The ever-increasing number of IoT devices in our surrounding environment bring us tremendous amount of opportunities but also challenges including limited battery life, low computational capability and scalability of multiple access. Recent advances in backscatter communication have enabled ubiquitous IoT devices to communicate in a cost-and power-efficient way. However, most of the proposed backscatter solutions nowadays focus on the single tag paradigm, i.e., multiple tags do not transmit simultaneously and thus the solutions have difficulties to scale with a large number of tags. This work presents CBMA, a backscatter system that enables multiple concurrent backscatter tags to communicate reliably and efficiently. For the first time, we demonstrate that multiple tags can backscatter concurrently and efficiently with novel impedance-based power control at the tag, and can be successfully decoded with commodity WiFi devices without affecting the existing WiFi communication. We present the design details of CBMA and build a prototype with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and FPGA. The CBMA system achieves a 10-tag bit rate of 8Mbps while supporting a communication distance up to 10m. Compared to single-tag solutions, CBMA improves the backscatter throughput by more than 10× even in challenging indoor scenarios with rich multipath and interference.},

We show that the maximum achievable diversity order of the monostatic channel is the diversity order achieved by the block-lever unitary query and orthogonal space-time block code (BUTQ-OSTBC) design pair, which is {\$}\backslashfrac {ML}{2}{\$} , exactly the half of the diversity order of the conventional MIMO channel. Then we show that uniform query, the simplest query approach, cannot achieve the maximum achievable diversity order in the monostatic channel. We generalize BUTQ-OSTBC to the general augmenting approach, and show that unitary matrix is optimal in terms of SER performance among all possible query matrices, when OSTBC is employed. The above results further indicate that in the backscatter channel, additional diversity can be obtained by varying the query signals over time slots within the channel coherent time, which is quite different from the results from the conventional MIMO channels.

However, existing studies on energy beamforming fail to simultaneously take energy supply and information transfer in WPBC into account. This paper takes the first step to fill this gap, by considering the restrictive relationship between the energy harvesting rate and achievable rate with estimated backscatter channel state information (BS-CSI). To ensure reliable communication and user fairness, we formulate the energy beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem by maximizing the minimum achievable rate for all backscatter tags subject to the energy constraint. We derive the closed-form expression of the energy harvesting rate, as well as the lower bound of the achievable rate for maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers. Our numerical results indicate that our scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art energy beamforming schemes. Additionally, the achievable rate of our scheme approaches more than 90{\%} of the rate limit achieved via beamforming with perfect CSI for both receivers.},

abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in a symbiotic radio (SR) system, in which a passive full-duplex backscatter device (BD) is parasitic in an active primary transmission. The primary transmitter (PT) with multiple antennas is designed to broadcast common messages to the primary receiver (PR) and the BD, as well as to support passive information transmission from the BD to the PR. To do so, the full-duplex BD absorbs a fraction of the incident signal from the PT to decode the common messages and simultaneously transmits its own information to the PR by backscattering the remaining part of the incident signal. We derive the achievable rates of the BD transmission with Gaussian and quadrature amplitude modulation codewords. We also formulate a transmit power minimization problem by jointly designing the beamforming vector at the PT and the power splitting factor at the BD. This problem is first solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique together with a one-dimensional linear exhaustive search over the power splitting factor. Then, a suboptimal but low-complexity solution with closed-form expressions is proposed. The simulation results have shown that the proposed suboptimal solution achieves almost the same performance as that obtained by the exhaustive search. In addition, our proposed SR system with the full-duplex BD outperforms the half-duplex system with the time-division-multiplexing mode in general.},

First, we consider the weighted sum bit error rate (BER) minimization problem among all IRSs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, IRS phase shift matrix, and IRS scheduling, subject to the minimum primary rate requirements. To tackle this complicated problem, a relaxation-based algorithm is proposed. We prove that the converged relaxation scheduling variables are binary, which means that no reconstruct strategy is needed, and thus the UAV rate constraints are automatically satisfied. Second, we consider the fairness BER optimization problem. We find that the relaxation-based method cannot solve this fairness BER problem since the minimum primary rate requirements may not be satisfied by the binary reconstruction operation. To address this issue, we first transform the binary constraints into a series of equivalent equality constraints. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed designs under different setups, as compared with benchmarks.},

The vision of massive IoT, involving billions of smart objects to be connected to the cellular network, needs to address the problem of uninterrupted power consumption while taking advantage of emerging high-frequency 5G communications. The problem of limited battery power motivates us to utilize radio frequency (RF) signals as the energy source for battery-free communications in next-generation wireless networks. Backscatter communication (BackCom) makes it possible to harvest energy from incident RF signals and reflect back parts of the same signals while modulating the data. Ambient BackCom (Amb-BackCom) is a type of BackCom that can harvest energy from nearby WiFi, TV, and cellular RF signals to modulate information. The objective of this article is to review BackCom as a solution to the limited battery life problem and enable future battery-free communications for combating the energy issues for devices in emerging wireless networks. We first highlight the energy constraint in existing wireless communications. We then investigate BackCom as a practical solution to the limited battery life problem. Subsequently, in order to take the advantages of omnipresent radio waves, we elaborate BackCom tag architecture and various types of BackCom. To understand encoding and data extraction, we demonstrate signal processing aspects that cover channel coding, interference, decoding, and signal detection schemes. Moreover, we also describe BackCom communication modes, modulation schemes, and multiple access techniques to accommodate maximum users with high throughput. Similarly, to mitigate the increased network energy, adequate data and power transfer schemes for BackCom are elaborated, in addition to reliability, security, and range extension. Finally, we highlight BackCom applications with existing research challenges and future directions for next-generation 5G wireless networks.},

This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and Dash7 alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

In recent years, researchers have determined methods for calculating the ergodic Shannon capacity for LN channels. However, in practical communication systems, the input signal is constrained to a discrete signaling set such as finite-size quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. At a high SNR, the Shannon capacity greatly overestimates the capacity of these practical systems, particularly for low-order constellations. For this reason, a method is needed to evaluate the capacity and outage probability for LN channels when the signal set is constrained to a finite alphabet. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a simple but accurate method for calculating both the ergodic Shannon capacity and the ergodic constrained capacity of practical signals for LN channels. This method also facilitates straightforward computation of outage probability and outage capacity. Prior to this work, the ergodic constrained capacity, outage probability, and outage capacity of practical signals for LN channels had not been dealt with in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

We aim to jointly design the transmit beamformer and IRS reflection to maximize the average sum-rate over all subcarriers. With the aid of the relationship between sum-rate maximization and mean square error (MSE) minimization, the original problem is equivalently transformed into a multi-block/variable problem, which can be solved by classic block coordinate descent (BCD) method.

Ambient backscattering devices reflect RF signals emitted by existing or legacy communications systems, such as digital TV broadcasting, cellular, or Wi-Fi ones, which are designed for transporting information and are not intended for RF energy transfer. This paper deals with mathematical modeling and performance analysis of wireless broadband networks operating over fading channels with ambient backscatter devices. After introducing a detailed signal model of the relevant communication links, we study the influence of physical parameters on the capacity of both legacy and backscatter channels, by considering different receiver architectures. We analytically show that, under reasonable operative conditions, a legacy system - employing an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme - can turn the RF interference arising from the backscatter process into a form of multipath diversity that can be exploited to increase its performance. Moreover, our analysis proves that a backscatter system - transmitting one symbol per OFDM symbol of the legacy system - can achieve satisfactory data rates over relatively short distances, especially when the intended recipient of the backscatter signal is co-located with the legacy transmitter, i.e., they are on the same device.},

abstract = {In a multi-user multi-antenna Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) network, the transmitter sends information to the Information Receivers (IRs) and energy to Energy Receivers (ERs) concurrently. A conventional approach is based on Multi-User Linear Precoding (MU-LP) where each IR directly decodes the intended stream by fully treating the interference from other IRs and ERs as noise. In this paper, we investigate the application of linearly-precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) in Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) SWIPT Broadcast Channel (BC). By splitting the messages of IRs into private and common parts and encoding the common parts into a common stream decoded by all IRs, RS manages the interference dynamically. The precoders are designed such that the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) of IRs is maximized under the total transmit power constraint and the sum energy constraint for ERs. Numerical results show that the proposed RS-assisted strategy provides a better rate-energy tradeoff in MISO SWIPT BC. Under a sum energy constraint of ERs, RS-assisted strategy achieves better WSR performance of IRs than MU-LP and NOMA in a wide range of IR and ER deployments. Hence, we draw the conclusion that RS is superior for downlink SWIPT networks.},

abstract = {The prospect of base station cooperation leading to joint combining at widely separated antennas has led to increased interest in macrodiversity systems, where both sources and receive antennas are geographically distributed. In this scenario, analytical investigation of channel capacity is extremely challenging for finite-size systems since the channel matrices have a very general form where each path may have a different power. Hence, in this paper, we consider the ergodic sum capacity of a macrodiversity multiple-input multiple-output system with arbitrary numbers of sources and receive antennas operating over Rayleigh fading channels. For this system, we compute the exact ergodic capacity for a system with at most two transmit antennas and a compact approximation for the general system, which is shown to be very accurate over a wide range of cases. Finally, we compare our results with previous asymptotic results and bounds. Results are verified by Monte Carlo simulations and the impact on capacity of various channel power profiles is investigated. {\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {In intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted communication systems, the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is a crucial impediment for achieving the beamforming gain of IRS because of the considerable overhead required for channel estimation. Specifically, under the current beamforming design for IRS-assisted communications, KMN +KM channel coefficients should be estimated, where K, N and M denote the numbers of users, IRS reflecting elements, and antennas at the base station (BS), respectively. These numbers can be extremely large in practice considering the current trend of massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), i.e., a large M, and massive connectivity, i.e., a large K. To accurately estimate such a large number of channel coefficients within a short time interval, we propose a novel three-phase pilot-based channel estimation framework in this paper for IRS-assisted uplink multiuser communications, in which the direct channels from the users to the BS, the IRS reflected channels of a typical user, and the IRS reflected channels of the other users are estimated in three consecutive phases, respectively. Under this framework, we analytically prove that a time duration consisting of K + N + max(K .. 1; d(K .. 1)N=Me) pilot symbols is sufficient for the BS to perfectly recover all the KMN + KM channel coefficients for the case without receiver noise at the BS. In contrast to the channel estimation for conventional uplink communications without IRS where the minimum channel estimation time is independent of the number of receive antennas at the BS, our result reveals the crucial role of massive MIMO in reducing the channel estimation time for IRS-assisted communications. Further, for the case with receiver noise, the user pilot sequences, IRS reflecting coefficients, and BS linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimators are characterized in closed-form, and the corresponding estimation mean-squared error (MSE) is quantified.},

abstract = {Wireless and batteryless sensing has recently attracted significant attention of researchers in IoT and WSN applications. It turns out to be more challenging when simultaneous data acquisition from multiple sensors is required. This paper introduces a non-orthogonal multiple access technique MSMA, using extremely simple wireless and batteryless sensor tags and a reader to support concurrent streaming from multiple sensors. By simultaneously handling non-orthogonal subcarriers, produced either by multiple or single sensor tag, it can realize concurrent sensor data streaming, which can be used in health monitoring of machinery and civil structures. The paper explains the two primary challenges in MSMA, the optimal assignment of subcarrier frequencies and the unavoidable harmonics from one subcarrier to others. Since the mutual interference among subcarriers is unevenly distributed over the available frequency band, random allocation of subcarrier frequencies may result in degraded system performance. Results show that the interference can be canceled out with the signal processing technique and the system communication capacity can be increased significantly with a proposed heuristic approach compared to random allocation of subcarrier frequencies to the sensor tags.},

The primary transmitter (PT) is designed to assist both the primary and BD transmissions, and the primary receiver (PR) is used to decode the information from the PT as well as the BD. The symbol period for BD transmission is assumed to be either equal to or much greater than that of the primary one, resulting in parasitic SR (PSR) or commensal SR (CSR) setup. We consider a basic SR system which consists of three nodes: 1) a multiantenna PT; 2) a single-antenna BD; and 3) a single-antenna PR. We first derive the achievable rates for the primary and BD transmissions for each setup. Then, we formulate two transmit beamforming optimization problems, i.e., the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem and the transmit power minimization (TPM) problem, and solve these nonconvex problems by applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. In addition, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the solutions. The simulation results show that for CSR setup, the proposed solution enables the opportunistic transmission for the BD via energy-efficient passive backscattering without any loss in spectral efficiency, by properly exploiting the additional signal path from the BD.},

To prevent confidential information leakage, multiple artificial redundant signals (MARSs) are embedded in the transmit signals. The goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming vectors and the covariance matrixes of MARSs, such that the minimal information rate and EH requirements at IRs and ERs are guaranteed while making the received signal-to-Interference ratio at ERs and Eves lower than their information decoding thresholds. Both the non-robust and the robust designs are studied. For the non-robust design, the optimal solution is derived. For the robust design, an approximate optimal solution is obtained by using Gaussian randomization procedure. Simulation results show that compared with traditional non-MARS-aided beamforming design, our proposed design is superior in terms of the total required transmit power. It also shows that employing the non-linear EH model can avoid false output power at the ERs and/or save power at the transmitter.},

abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technique for future wireless communication networks. How to reliably transmit information in a RIS-based communication system arouses much interest. This paper proposes a reflecting modulation (RM) scheme for RIS-based communications, where both the reflecting patterns and transmit signals can carry information. Depending on that the transmitter and RIS jointly or independently deliver information, RM is further classified into two categories: jointly mapped RM (JRM) and separately mapped RM (SRM). JRM and SRM are naturally superior to existing schemes, because the transmit signal vectors, reflecting patterns, and bit mapping methods of JRM and SRM are more flexibly designed. To enhance transmission reliability, this paper proposes a discrete optimization-based joint signal mapping, shaping, and reflecting (DJMSR) design for JRM and SRM to minimize the bit error rate (BER) with a given transmit signal candidate set and a given reflecting pattern candidate set. To further improve the performance, this paper optimizes multiple reflecting patterns and their associated transmit signal sets in continuous fields for JRM and SRM. Numerical results show that JRM and SRM with the proposed system optimization methods considerably outperform existing schemes in BER.},

Different from conventional orthogonal multiple access technologies, NOMA can accommodate much more users via nonorthogonal resource allocation.

We discuss their principles, key features, and pros/cons, and then provide a comprehensive comparison of these solutions from the perspective of spectral efficiency, system performance, receiver complexity, and so on.

abstract = {In this paper, we consider a novel ambient backscatter multiple-access system, where a receiver (Rx) simultaneously detects the signals transmitted from an active transmitter (Tx) and a backscatter Tag. Specifically, the information-carrying signal sent by the Tx arrives at the Rx through two wireless channels: the direct channel from the Tx to the Rx, and the backscatter channel from the Tx to the Tag and then to the Rx. The received signal from the backscatter channel also carries the Tag's information because of the multiplicative backscatter operation at the Tag. This multiple-access system introduces a new channel model, referred to as multiplicative multiple-access channel (M-MAC). We analyze the achievable rate region of the M-MAC and prove that its region is strictly larger than that of the conventional time-division multiple-access scheme in many cases, including, e.g., the high SNR regime and the case when the direct channel is much stronger than the backscatter channel. Hence, the multiplicative multiple-access scheme is an attractive technique to improve the throughput for ambient backscatter communication systems. Moreover, we analyze the detection error rates for coherent and noncoherent modulation schemes adopted by the Tx and the Tag, respectively, in both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios, which further bring interesting insights for practical system design.},

abstract = {The explosion of the number of low-power devices in the next decades calls for a re-thinking of wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum, radiation, and infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. This paper provides a novel learning-based approach towards such wireless network design. To that end, a parametric model of a practical energy harvester, accounting for various sources of nonlinearities, is proposed using a nonlinear regression algorithm applied over collected real data. Relying on the proposed model, the learning problem of modulation design for Simultaneous Wireless Information-Power Transmission (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using Neural Network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that by increasing the receiver power demand, the baseband transmit modulation constellation converges to an On-Off keying signalling. Utilizing the observations obtained via learning, an algorithmic SWIPT modulation design is proposed. It is observed via numerical results that the performance loss of the proposed modulations are negligible compared to the ones obtained from learning. Extension of the studied problem to learning modulation design for multi-user SWIPT scenarios and coded modulation design for point-to-point SWIPT are considered. The major conclusion of this work is to utilize learning-based results to design non learning-based algorithms, which perform as well. In particular, inspired by the results obtained via learning, an algorithmic approach for coded modulation design is proposed, which performs very close to its learning counterparts, and is significantly superior due to its high real-time adaptability to new system design parameters.},

To maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of IRs, the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices of the BS and passive phase shift matrix of the IRS should be jointly optimized. To tackle this challenging optimization problem, we first adopt the classic block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for decoupling the original optimization problem into several subproblems and alternatively optimize the TPC matrices and the phase shift matrix. For each subproblem, we provide a low-complexity iterative algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of each subproblem. The BCD algorithm is rigorously proved to converge to the KKT point of the original problem. We also conceive a feasibility checking method to study its feasibility. Our extensive simulation results confirm that employing IRSs in SWIPT beneficially enhances the system performance and the proposed BCD algorithm converges rapidly, which is appealing for practical applications.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and revolutionizing technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless networks. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF) signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve high passive beamforming gains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency of RF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in this paper an IRS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Specifically, a set of IRSs are deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), respectively. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP via jointly optimizing its transmit precoders and the reflect phase shifts at all IRSs, subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints at all users, namely, the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at IUs and the energy harvesting constraints at EUs. However, this optimization problem is non-convex with intricately coupled variables, for which the existing alternating optimization approach is shown to be inefficient as the number of QoS constraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper transformations on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the penalty-based optimization method. Moreover, by exploiting the short-range coverage of IRS, we further propose a more computationally efficient algorithm by optimizing the phase shifts at all IRSs in parallel. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of employing multiple IRSs for enhancing the performance of SWIPT systems as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed algorithms over benchmark schemes. The impact of IRS on the transmitter/receiver design for SWIPT is also unveiled.},

In this paper, we study a backscatter-assisted wireless powered communication network (BS-WPCN), in which a number of energy-constrained users, powered by a power station (PS), transmit information to an access point (AP) via backscatter and active wireless information transfer, with their communication being aided by an IRS.

abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation time of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter. We first consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel condition that is assumed to be known at the receiver. We derive the optimal power splitting rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between the maximum ergodic capacity for information transfer and the maximum average harvested energy for power transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called «rate-energy (R-E)» region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information is also known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmitter power control and receiver power splitting. The achievable R-E region by the proposed DPS scheme is also compared against that by the existing time switching scheme as well as a performance upper bound by ignoring the practical receiver constraint. Finally, we extend the result for optimal DPS to the SIMO (single-input multiple-output) system where the receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. In particular, we investigate a low-complexity power splitting scheme, namely antenna switching, which achieves the near-optimal rate-energy trade-offs as compared to the optimal DPS. {\textcopyright} 1972-2012 IEEE.},

In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying co-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the unintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We further assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or harvest energy at any time due to the practical circuit limitation. Therefore, it is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two modes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the instantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we determine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited information transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited information transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the receiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called "outage-energy" region and "rate-energy" region, respectively. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmit power control, information and energy transfer scheduling, and the receiver's mode switching.

In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximumlikelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RFsource signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.},

The surface contains metamaterial that is configured to 'reflect' the incident wave from the source towards the destination. Two incompatible pathloss models have been used in prior work. In this letter, we derive the far-field pathloss using physical optics techniques and explain why the surface consists of many elements that individually act as diffuse scatterers but can jointly beamform the signal in a desired direction with a certain beamwidth. We disprove one of the previously conjectured pathloss models.},

abstract = {Scatter radio achieves communication by reflection and requires low-cost and low-power RF front-ends. However, its use in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is limited, since commercial scatter radio (e.g. RFID) offers short ranges of a few tens of meters. This work redesigns scatter radio systems and maximizes range through non-classic bistatic architectures: the carrier emitter is detached from the reader. It is shown that conventional radio receivers may show a potential 3dB performance loss, since they do not exploit the correct signal model for scatter radio links. Receivers for on-off-keying (OOK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) that overcome the frequency offset between the carrier emitter and the reader are presented. Additionally, non-coherent designs are also offered. This work emphasizes that sensor tag design should accompany receiver design. Impact of important parameters such as the antenna structural mode are presented through bit error rate (BER) results. Experimental measurements corroborate the long-range ability of bistatic radio; ranges of up to 130 meters with 20 milliwatts of carrier power are experimentally demonstrated, with commodity software radio and no directional antennas. Therefore, bistatic scatter radio may be viewed as a key enabling technology for large-scale, low-cost and low-power WSNs. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

We formulate a problem to minimize the BS's transmit power by jointly optimizing the BS's active beamforming and the RIS's phase shifts (i.e., passive beamforming), under the signal-to-noise-ratio constraints of the primary and IoT transmission as well as the RIS's phase-shift constraints. However, the problem is challenging to be solved optimally, since the optimization variables are coupled and the constraints are non-convex. An efficient iterative algorithm based on the block coordinated descent and modified semidefinite relaxation techniques is proposed to solve this problem for both discrete and continuous phase shift scenarios. The convergency of the algorithm is proved and the complexity of the algorithm is analyzed. Numerical results validate that the proposed system outperforms the benchmark of traditional broadcasting system without RIS.},

abstract = {It is well known that the maximum amount of power in an electrical or electronic system can be transferred to a load when its impedance is the complex conjugate of the source impedance, although, the power transfer efficiency is only 50{\%}. Is this fact true for a radio system, as well? The question has existed for decades. In this article, the equivalent circuits of antenna systems are reexamined. It is demonstrated that classical equivalent circuit models based on the Thvenin and Norton theorems are not suitable for a receiving antenna system since the antenna cannot be simply approximated by a voltage or current source. A constant power source is required but not readily available. Thus, two new general power source models are introduced and examined. It is found that they may be suitable for a transmitting antenna system but not accurate enough for a receiving antenna when the antenna loss is taken into account. A novel special constant power source model is therefore proposed and shown to accurately simulate the behavior of a receiving antenna. When the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the antenna impedance, maximum power is obtained, and the power transfer efficiency is simultaneously maximized (up to 100{\%} if the antenna system is lossless).},

abstract = {Symbiotic radio is a promising technology to achieve spectrum- and energy-efficient wireless communications, where the secondary backscatter device (BD) leverages not only the spectrum but also the power of the primary signals for its own information transmission. In return, the primary communication link can be enhanced by the additional multipaths created by the BD. This is known as the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio. However, as the backscattering link is much weaker than the direct link due to double attenuations, the improvement of the primary link brought by one single BD is extremely limited. To address this issue and enable full mutualism of symbiotic radio, in this paper, we study symbiotic radio with massive number of BDs. For symbiotic radio multiple access channel (MAC) with successive interference cancellation (SIC), we first derive the achievable rate of both the primary and secondary communications, based on which a receive beamforming optimization problem is formulated and solved. Furthermore, considering the asymptotic regime of massive number of BDs, closed-form expressions are derived for the primary and the secondary communication rates, both of which are shown to be increasing functions of the number of BDs. This thus demonstrates that the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio can be fully exploited with massive BD access.},

Different from the current LTE radio access scheme (until Release 11), NOMA superposes multiple users in the power domain although its basic signal waveform could be based on the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) or the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-spread OFDM the same as LTE baseline. In our concept, NOMA adopts a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver as the baseline receiver scheme for robust multiple access, considering the expected evolution of device processing capabilities in the future. Based on system-level evaluations, we show that the downlink NOMA with SIC improves both the capacity and cell-edge user throughput performance irrespective of the availability of the frequency-selective channel quality indicator (CQI) on the base station side. Furthermore, we discuss possible extensions of NOMA by jointly applying multi-antenna/site technologies with a proposed NOMA/MIMO scheme using SIC and an interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver to achieve further capacity gains, e.g., a three-fold gain in the spectrum efficiency representing a challenging target for FRA. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is no longer a “wild” or “promising” concept for future cellular networks—in 2018 it became a reality. Base stations (BSs) with 64 fully digital transceiver chains were commercially deployed in several countries, the key ingredients of Massive MIMO have made it into the 5G standard, the signal processing methods required to achieve unprecedented spectral efficiency have been developed, and the limitation due to pilot contamination has been resolved. Even the development of fully digital Massive MIMO arrays for mmWave frequencies—once viewed prohibitively complicated and costly—is well underway. In a few years, Massive MIMO with fully digital transceivers will be a mainstream feature at both sub-6 GHz and mmWave frequencies. In this paper, we explain how the first chapter of the Massive MIMO research saga has come to an end, while the story has just begun. The coming wide-scale deployment of BSs with massive antenna arrays opens the door to a brand new world where spatial processing capabilities are omnipresent. In addition to mobile broadband services, the antennas can be used for other communication applications, such as low-power machine-type or ultra-reliable communications, as well as non-communication applications such as radar, sensing and positioning.

abstract = {Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has attracted significant attention in recent years. Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research community in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the design of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect of transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform so as to enhance the dc power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a tractable model of the nonlinearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear model conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design novel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information (CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission with all the power allocated to a single frequency, the nonlinear model favours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic simulations, waveforms designed based on the nonlinear model are shown to provide significant gains (in terms of harvested dc power) over those designed based on the linear model and over nonadaptive waveforms. We also compute analytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various waveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those scaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT and of a WPT design based on a nonlinear rectenna model over a linear model. Results also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on large-scale multisine multiantenna waveforms for WPT. As a final note, results stress the importance of modeling and accounting for the nonlinearity of the rectenna in any system design involving wireless power.},

abstract = {The use of multisine signals to improve the efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT) for low average received power was proposed recently. Several measurement-based studies illustrated the gain that can be achieved for different circuit or waveform instances, focusing on the impact of a time-varying amplitude on the rectifying efficiency. This paper first establishes a model enabling a thorough analysis of the multisine-based WPT system focusing on the bandwidth of the signal and the rectifier. This model enables a codesign of signal and rectifier for optimal WPT. The proposed model provides insight into the output voltage and power, as a function of the input waveform for different circuit models. By including the input matching and the clamper, our model is generic and can include a wide range of rectifiers with different voltage multiplication approaches. The key insight gained from our analysis is that there is a tradeoff between the frequency spacing of the tones of the multisine signal and the cut-off frequency of the low-pass RC filter, as a main property of the rectifier circuit. Our model predicts the measured power conversion efficiency and voltage with an error below 0.1 and 0.2 V, respectively.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) that enables the control of wireless propagation environment has recently emerged as a promising cost-effective technology for boosting the spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless communication systems. Prior works on IRS are mainly based on the ideal phase shift model assuming the full signal reflection by each of the elements regardless of its phase shift, which, however, is practically difficult to realize. In contrast, we propose in this paper the practical phase shift model that captures the phase-dependent amplitude variation in the element-wise reflection coefficient. Based on the proposed model and considering an IRS-aided multiuser system with an IRS deployed to assist in the downlink communications from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly designing the AP transmit beamforming and the IRS reflect beamforming, subject to the users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Iterative algorithms are proposed to find suboptimal solutions to this problem efficiently by utilizing the alternating optimization (AO) or penalty-based optimization technique. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance loss of the IRS-aided system that employs practical phase shifters but assumes the ideal phase shift model for beamforming optimization, as the number of IRS elements goes to infinity. Simulation results unveil substantial performance gains achieved by the proposed beamforming optimization based on the practical phase shift model as compared to the conventional ideal model.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new technology for achieving both spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication systems in the future. However, existing works on IRS mainly consider frequency-flat channels and assume perfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Motivated by this, in this paper we study an IRS-enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective channels and propose a practical transmission protocol with channel estimation. First, to reduce the overhead in channel training and estimation and to exploit the channel spatial correlation, we propose a novel IRS elements grouping method, where each group consists of a set of adjacent IRS elements that share a common reflection coefficient. Based on this grouping method, we propose a practical transmission protocol where only the combined channel of each group needs to be estimated, thus substantially reducing the training overhead. Next, with any given grouping and estimated CSI, we formulate the problem to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation and the IRS passive array reflection coefficients. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by alternately optimizing the power allocation and the passive array coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the initialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the case without using IRS. Moreover, it is shown that there exists an optimal size for IRS elements grouping which achieves the maximum achievable rate due to the trade-off between the training overhead and IRS passive beamforming flexibility.},

abstract = {We study RF-enabled wireless energy transfer (WET) via energy beamforming, from a multi-antenna energy transmitter (ET) to multiple energy receivers (ERs) in a backscatter communication system such as RFID. The acquisition of the forward-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER) state information (F-CSI) at the ET (or RFID reader) is challenging, since the ERs (or RFID tags) are typically too energy-and-hardware-constrained to estimate or feedback the F-CSI. The ET leverages its observed backscatter signals to estimate the backscatter-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER-to-ET) state information (BS-CSI) directly. We first analyze the harvested energy obtained using the estimated BS-CSI. Furthermore, we optimize the resource allocation to maximize the total utility of harvested energy. For WET to single ER, we obtain the optimal channel-training energy in a semiclosed form. For WET to multiple ERs, we optimize the channel-training energy and the energy allocation weights for different energy beams. For the straightforward weighted-sum-energy (WSE) maximization, the optimal WET scheme is shown to use only one energy beam, which leads to unfairness among ERs and motivates us to consider the complicated proportional-fair-energy (PFE) maximization. For PFE maximization, we show that it is a biconvex problem, and propose a block-coordinate-descent-based algorithm to find the close-to-optimal solution. Numerical results show that with the optimized solutions, the harvested energy suffers slight reduction of less than 10{\%}, compared to that obtained using the perfect F-CSI.},

abstract = {Quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) with double-sided constraints has plenty of applications in signal processing as have been addressed in recent years. QCQP problems are hard to solve, in general, and they are typically approached by solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation followed by a postprocessing procedure. Existing postprocessing schemes include Gaussian randomization to generate an approximate solution, rank reduction procedure (the so-called purification), and some specific rank-one matrix decomposition techniques to yield a globally optimal solution. In this paper, we propose several randomized postprocessing methods to output not an approximate solution but a globally optimal solution for some solvable instances of the double-sided QCQP (i.e., instances with a small number of constraints). We illustrate their applicability in robust receive beamforming, radar optimal code design, and broadcast beamforming for multiuser communications. As a byproduct, we derive an alternative (shorter) proof for the Sturm-Zhang rank-one matrix decomposition theorem. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {A Cell-Free Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system comprises a very large number of distributed access points (APs), which simultaneously serve a much smaller number of users over the same time/frequency resources based on directly measured channel characteristics. The APs and users have only one antenna each. The APs acquire channel state information through time-division duplex operation and the reception of uplink pilot signals transmitted by the users. The APs perform multiplexing/de-multiplexing through conjugate beamforming on the downlink and matched filtering on the uplink. Closed-form expressions for individual user uplink and downlink throughputs lead to max-min power control algorithms. Max-min power control ensures uniformly good service throughout the area of coverage. A pilot assignment algorithm helps to mitigate the effects of pilot contamination, but power control is far more important in that regard. Cell-Free Massive MIMO has considerably improved performance with respect to a conventional small-cell scheme, whereby each user is served by a dedicated AP, in terms of both 95{\%}-likely per-user throughput and immunity to shadow fading spatial correlation. Under uncorrelated shadow fading conditions, the cell-free scheme provides nearly fivefold improvement in 95{\%}-likely per-user throughput over the small-cell scheme, and tenfold improvement when shadow fading is correlated.},

However, no effort have been made to design an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm with Quality of Service (QoS) requirement, and this observation motivates our work. In this paper, we consider a classical bistatic backscatter system, where the backscatter node first harvests energy from the dedicated power source in the sleep phase, then backscatters its information to the receiver and harvests energy simultaneously through a reflection coefficient in the active phase. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable energy efficiency, subject to the energy causality and QoS requirement, by optimizing the transmit power at the dedicated power source, the reflection coefficient, the time for sleep phase and active phase. As the formulated problem is a non-convex fractional programming problem and hard to solve, by means of the fractional programming, we firstly transform it in the fractional form as an equivalent problem in the subtractive form. By introducing several auxiliary variables and employing the monotonicity of the objective function, we show that the transformed problem can be reduced to one of the following two convex problems corresponding to two scenarios, i.e., the transmitter always operates in the active state and the dedicated power source adopts the maximum allowed power. Simulation results are provided to verify our findings and show the advantage of the proposed scheme in terms of energy efficiency.},

We show that in the high Signal-toInterference Ratios (SIR) regime, these nonlinear and apparently difficult, nonconvex optimization problems can be transformed into convex optimization problems in the form of geometric programming; hence they can be very efficiently solved for global optimality even with a large number of users. In the medium to low SIR regime, some of these constrained nonlinear optimization of power control cannot be turned into tractable convex formulations, but a heuristic can be used to compute in most cases the optimal solution by solving a series of geometric programs through the approach of successive convex approximation. While efficient and robust algorithms have been extensively studied for centralized solutions of geometric programs, distributed algorithms have not been explored before. We present a systematic method of distributed algorithms for power control that is geometric- programming-based.

In the literature, different models have been proposed mainly for relatively small and large input power regimes of an EH. Due to the complexity of the proposed nonlinear models, obtaining analytical optimal or well performing signal designs have been extremely challenging. Relying on the proposed models in the literature, the learning problem of modulation design for simultaneous wireless information-power transfer (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using neural network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that for relatively small channel input powers, as the power demand increases at the receiver, one of the symbols is shot away from the origin while the remaining symbols approach zero amplitude. In the very extreme case of merely receiver power demand, the modulations are in the form of On-Off keying signalling with a low probability of the On signal. On the other side, for relatively large channel input powers, it is observed that as the receiver power demand increases, a number of symbols approach zero amplitude, whereas the others (more than one symbol) get equally high amplitudes but with different phases. In the extreme scenario of merely receiver power demand, the modulation resembles multiple On-Off keying signalling with different phases.},

abstract = {Theoretical discussions and experimental verifications are presented for a multiband frequency selective surface (FSS) with perfectly conducting multiring patch elements. It is found that the narrow-ring approximation is valid for a ring width less than 0.025A with A being the wavelength of the FSS's resonant frequency. A single screen double-ring element FSS is demonstrated for (1) a low-pass FSS that reflects the Ka-band signal while passing the S-, X-, and Ku-band signals, and (2) a Tri-bandsystem that reflects the X-band signal while transmitting through the S- and Ku-band signals. In addition, a double screen four-band FSS with non-similar double-ring elements is developed by cascading the above mentioned two single screens. The good agreement obtained between the measured and the computed results verified the computer codes and the approaches of this paper. {\textcopyright} 1994 IEEE},

abstract = {The future of mobile communications looks exciting with the potential new use cases and challenging requirements of future 6th generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. Since the beginning of the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding objects. The recent advent of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics of the radiowaves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. Recent results have revealed that reconflgurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations. Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions, and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces necessitates to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks. This article also explores theoretical performance limits of reconflgurable intelligent surface-assisted communication systems using mathematical techniques and elaborates on the potential use cases of intelligent surfaces in 6G and beyond wireless networks.},

abstract = {Because of the powerful symbol error performance of multiuser maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, recently, there has been much interest in seeking effective ways of approximating multiuser ML detection (MLD) with affordable computational costs. It has been illustrated that for the synchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) scenario, the so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm can accurately and efficiently approximate multiuser MLD. This SDR-MLD algorithm, however, can only handle binary and quadratic phase shift keying (PSK) symbol constellations. In this sequel, we propose an extended SDR algorithm for MLD with M-ary PSK (MPSK) constellations. For the synchronous CDMA scenario, the proposed SDR algorithm provides an attractive polynomial-time complexity order of K3.5, where K is the number of users. Simulation results indicate that the proposed detector provides improved symbol error performance compared with several commonly used multiuser detectors. {\textcopyright} 2004, IEEE.

In particular, RIS-assisted wireless communications have the great potential to achieve significant performance improvement and coverage enhancement in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner, by properly programming the reflection coefficients of the unit cells of RISs. In this paper, the free-space path loss models of RIS-assisted wireless communications are developed for different scenarios by studying the physics and electromagnetic nature of RISs. The proposed models, which are first validated through extensive simulation results, reveal the relationships between the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications and the distances from the transmitter/receiver to the RIS, the size of the RIS, the near-field/far-field effects of the RIS, and the radiation patterns of antennas and unit cells. In addition, three fabricated RISs (metasurfaces) are utilized to further corroborate theoretical findings through experimental measurements conducted in a microwave anechoic chamber. The measurement results match well with the modeling results, thus validating the proposed free-space path loss models for RIS, which may pave the way for further theoretical studies and practical applications in this field.},

In this letter, we propose and analyse a Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) strategy based on the three-node relay channel where the transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas. By splitting user messages and linearly precoding common and private streams at the transmitter, and opportunistically asking the relaying user to forward its decoded common message, CRS can efficiently cope with a wide range of propagation conditions (disparity of user channel strengths and directions) and compensate for the performance degradation due to deep fading. The precoder design and the resource allocation are optimized by solving the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) maximization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed CRS scheme can achieve an explicit rate region improvement compared to its non-cooperative counterpart and other cooperative strategies (such as cooperative NOMA).},

In this paper, we consider a cooperative cognitive backscatter network (CCBN) consisting of a multi-antenna RF-Source, multiple (ambient) BDs, and a multi-antenna cooperative receiver (C-RX). We derive the achievable rates for the C-RX decoding the direct-link signal from the RF-Source and the backscatter-link signal from all BDs, respectively. We further formulate an optimization problem to maximize the backscatter-link sum rate by optimizing the beamforming weights (i.e., the precoding matrix) subject to the RF-Source's minimum rate requirement and the BDs' minimum energy requirements. Based on the sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method, we propose an algorithm to find the optimal solution to the original non-convex problem, by using a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) problems to approximate the original problem iteratively. Finally, extensive numerical results show that the optimal beamforming solution enhances the BDs' sum rate significantly compared to the omnidirectional transmission, and demonstrate the tradeoff among the direct-link rate of the RF-Source, the sum rate of all BDs, as well as the energy requirements at the BDs.},

A particularly interesting and challenging scenario arises when sources perform simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), as strong signals not only increase power transfer but also interference.

abstract = {The capacity of a complex and discrete-time memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel under three constraints, namely, input average power, input amplitude and output delivered power is studied. The output delivered power constraint is modelled as the average of linear combination of even moments of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under transmit average power and receiver delivered power constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an average power constraint. However, depending on the two constraints, the capacity can be either achieved by a Gaussian distribution or arbitrarily approached by using time-sharing between a Gaussian distribution and On-Off Keying. As an application, a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated nonlinear model of the harvester is used. It is shown that the delivered power depends on higher order moments of the channel input. Two inner bounds, one based on complex Gaussian inputs and the other based on further restricting the delivered power are obtained for the Rate-Power (RP) region. For Gaussian inputs, the optimal inputs are zero mean and a tradeoff between transmitted information and delivered power is recognized by considering asymmetric power allocations between inphase and quadrature subchannels. Through numerical algorithms, it is observed that input distributions (obtained by restricting the delivered power) attain larger RP region compared to Gaussian input counterparts.},

abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted great attention as a potential beyond 5G technology. These surfaces consist of many passive elements of metamaterials whose impedance can be controllable to change the characteristics of wireless signals impinging on them. Channel estimation is a critical task when it comes to the control of a large RIS when having a channel with a large number of multipath components. In this paper, we propose novel channel estimation schemes for different RIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations. The proposed methods exploit spatial correlation characteristics at both the base station and the planar RISs, and other statistical characteristics of multi-specular fading in a mobile environment. Moreover, a novel heuristic for phase-shift selection at the RISs is developed. For the RIS-assisted massive MIMO, a new receive combining method and a fixed-point algorithm, which solves the max-min fairness power control optimally, are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed uplink RIS-aided framework improves the spectral efficiency of the cell-edge mobile user equipments substantially in comparison to a conventional single-cell massive MIMO system. The impact of several channel effects are studied to gain insight about which RIS configuration is preferable and when the channel estimation is necessary to boost the spectral efficiency.},

A model is described from which max-min fairness of rates emerges as a limiting special case; more generally, the charges users are prepared to pay influence their allocated rates. In the preferred version of the model, a user chooses the charge per unit time that the user will pay; thereafter the user's rate is determined by the network according to a proportional fairness criterion applied to the rate per unit charge. A system optimum is achieved when users' choices of charges and the network's choice of allocated rates are in equilibrium.},

abstract = {In this paper, we exploit the radio diversity gain in a multi-user hybrid radio network wirelessly powered by a power beacon station (PBS). Each user has a dual-mode radio that can switch between the passive and active modes, according to the channel and energy conditions. This provides extra degree of freedom to improve the overall network performance. As such, we propose a throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing the PBS' energy beamforming and the radios' transmission scheduling strategies in two modes. We show that the throughput maximization is easily tractable by solving a semi-definite program. However, it becomes non-convex and intractable when we allow radios' cooperation in data transmissions. To this end, we propose a set of heuristic algorithms with different complexities for cooperative relay transmissions, which are shown to significantly improve the sum throughput compared to the non-cooperative case. The simulation results show that a simple adaptive scheme can achieve the maximum throughput according to the PBS' power supply.},

abstract = {One of the key enablers of future wireless communications is constituted by massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which can improve the spectral efficiency by orders of magnitude. In existing massive MIMO systems, however, conventional phased arrays are used for beamforming. This method results in excessive power consumption and high hardware costs. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the revolutionary technologies to enable energy-efficient and smart wireless communications, which is a two-dimensional structure with a large number of passive elements. In this paper, we develop a new type of high-gain yet low-cost RIS that bears 256 elements. The proposed RIS combines the functions of phase shift and radiation together on an electromagnetic surface, where positive intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are used to realize 2-bit phase shifting for beamforming. This radical design forms the basis for the world's first wireless communication prototype using RIS having 256 two-bit elements. The prototype consists of modular hardware and flexible software that encompass the following: the hosts for parameter setting and data exchange, the universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for baseband and radio frequency (RF) signal processing, as well as the RIS for signal transmission and reception. Our performance evaluation confirms the feasibility and efficiency of RISs in wireless communications. We show that, at 2.3 GHz, the proposed RIS can achieve a 21.7 dBi antenna gain. At the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, that is, 28.5 GHz, it attains a 19.1 dBi antenna gain. Furthermore, it has been shown that the RIS-based wireless communication prototype developed is capable of significantly reducing the power consumption.},

We assume that each user has a dual-mode radio architecture and can operate in either conventional active RF communications or passive backscatter communications. In the latter, the data transmission relies on the reflection of ambient RF signals. We capitalize the fact that the two communications technologies can complement each other in a hybrid radio network, by proposing the passive relaying scheme for active RF communications. Specifically, each active RF radio is allocated a fixed time slot for its data transmission. It is also assisted by a set of passive radios via backscattering the RF signals of the active radio. Though passive relaying is energy efficient as it consumes minuscule amount of energy in backscatter communications, it indeed competes the channel time that can be used by the passive radios to harvest RF energy. We propose a game-theoretic approach to balance energy harvesting and relaying performance, by allowing each passive radio to iteratively optimize its reflection coefficients. The simulation results verify that the passive relaying scheme significantly enhances the sum throughput of a hybrid radio network.},

abstract = {In this paper we study semidefinite programming (SDP) models for a class of discrete and continuous quadratic optimization problems in the complex Hermitian form. These problems capture a class of well-known combinatorial optimization problems, as well as problems in control theory. For instance, they include the MAX-3-CUT problem where the Laplacian matrix is positive semidefinite (in particular, some of the edge weights can be negative). We present a generic algorithm and a unified analysis of the SDP relaxations which allow us to obtain good approximation guarantees for our models. Specifically, we give an (k sin($\pi$/k))2/(4$\pi$) -approximation algorithm for the discrete problem where the decision variables are k-ary and the objective matrix is positive semidefinite. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known approximation result for this family of problems. For the continuous problem where the objective matrix is positive semidefinite, we obtain the well-known $\pi$ /4 result due to Ben-Tal et al. [Math Oper Res 28(3):497-523, 2003], and independently, Zhang and Huang [SIAM J Optim 16(3):871-890, 2006]. However, our techniques simplify their analyses and provide a unified framework for treating those problems. In addition, we show for the first time that the gap between the optimal value of the original problem and that of the SDP relaxation can be arbitrarily close to $\pi$ /4. We also show that the unified analysis can be used to obtain an $\Omega$(1/ log n)-approximation algorithm for the continuous problem in which the objective matrix is not positive semidefinite. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new spectrum sharing model referred to as riding on the primary (ROP) is proposed for wireless-powered IoT devices with ambient backscatter communication capabilities. The key idea of ROP is that the secondary transmitter harvests energy from the primary signal, then modulates its information bits to the primary signal, and reflects the modulated signal to the secondary receiver without violating the primary system's interference requirement. Compared with the conventional spectrum sharing model, the secondary system in the proposed ROP not only utilizes the spectrum of the primary system but also takes advantage of the primary signal to harvest energy and to carry its information. In this paper, we investigate the performance of such a spectrum sharing system under fading channels. To be specific, we maximize the ergodic capacity of the secondary system by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the primary signal and the reflection coefficient of the secondary ambient backscatter. Different (ideal/practical) energy consumption models, different (peak/average) transmit power constraints, different types (fixed/dynamically adjustable) reflection coefficient, different primary system's interference requirements (rate/outage) are considered. Optimal power allocation and reflection coefficient are obtained for each scenario.},

Contrary to existing works, we consider a rather unorthodox transmission scheme. In particular, the message intended to one of the users is split into two parts: a common part which can be recovered by all users, and a private part recovered by the corresponding user. On the other hand, the rest of users receive their information through private messages. This rate-splitting (RS) approach was shown to boost the achievable degrees of freedom when CSIT errors decay with increased SNR. In this paper, the RS strategy is married with linear precoder design and optimization techniques to achieve a maximized ergodic SR (ESR) performance over the entire range of SNRs. Precoders are designed based on partial CSIT knowledge by solving a stochastic rate optimization problem using means of sample average approximation coupled with the weighted minimum mean square error approach. Numerical results show that in addition to the ESR gains, the benefits of RS also include relaxed CSIT quality requirements and enhanced achievable rate regions compared with conventional transmission with no rate-splitting.},

The base station divides the set of users into disjunct pairs and assigns the available resources to these pairs. The combinatorial problem of user pairing to achieve the maximum sum rate is analyzed in the large system limit for various scenarios, and some optimum and sub-optimum algorithms with a polynomial-time complexity are proposed. In the first scenario, 2M users and the base station have a single-antenna and communicate over M subcarriers. The performance of optimum pairing is derived for M → ∞ and shown to be superior to random pairing and orthogonal multiple access techniques. In the second setting, a novel NOMA scheme for a multi-antenna base station and single carrier communication is proposed. In this case, the users need not be aware of the pairing strategy. Furthermore, the proposed NOMA scheme is generalized to multi-antenna users. It is shown that random and optimum user pairing perform similarly in the large system limit, but optimum pairing is significantly better in finite dimensions. It is shown that the proposed NOMA scheme outperforms a previously proposed NOMA scheme with signal alignment.},

Spontaneous emission from inline optical amplifiers is assumed to be the dominant noise source in all cases. Coherent detection allows use of two degrees of freedom per polarization, and its spectral efficiency limits are several b/s/Hz in typical terrestrial systems, even considering nonlinear effects. Using either constant-intensity modulation or direct detection, only one degree of freedom per polarization can be used, significantly reducing spectral efficiency. Using binary modulation, regardless of detection technique, spectral efficiency cannot exceed 1 b/s/Hz per polarization. When the number of signal and/or noise photons is small, the particle nature of photons must be considered. The quantum-limited spectral efficiency for coherent detection is slightly smaller than the classical capacity, but that for direct detection is 0.3 b/s/Hz higher than its classical counterpart. Various binary and nonbinary modulation techniques, in conjunction with appropriate detection techniques, are compared in terms of their spectral efficiencies and signal-to-noise ratio requirements, assuming amplified spontaneous emission is the dominant noise source. These include a) pulse-amplitude modulation with direct detection, b) differential phase-shift keying with interferometric detection, c) phase-shift keying with coherent detection, and d) quadrature-amplitude modulation with coherent detection.},

Taking advantage of the fact that the zero duality gap holds for the non-convex quadratic problems, a closed-form expression for an estimate of the CSI error vector is derived, completing the formulation. Finally, a novel iterative algorithm based on both the herein derived CSI error vector and the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is contributed, which is shown to capable of efficiently solving the constrained min-power problem.

Firstly, users use a fraction of the previously harvested energy to send pilots, while the H-AP estimates the uplink channels and obtains the downlink channels by exploiting channel reciprocity. Next, the H-AP utilizes the channel estimates just obtained to transfer wireless energy to all users in the downlink via energy beamforming. Finally, the users use a portion of the harvested energy to send data to the H-AP simultaneously in the uplink (reserving some harvested energy for sending pilots in the next frame). To optimize the throughput and ensure rate fairness, we consider the problem of maximizing the minimum rate among all users.

We provide a general tag load selection methodology that applies to any tag antenna, including minimum scattering antennas as a special case. The method is based on tag antenna structural mode closed-form calculation (given three values of tag radar cross section), employs simple antenna/communication theory, and applies to both passive, as well as semipassive RFID tags. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Following a nonlinear energy harvesting model, we express the relationship between the harvested direct current (DC) power and the power of the received radio-frequency signal via an implicit function, based on which the convex property is further proved. In particular, for a predefined rectifier's input signal distribution, we show that the harvested DC power of the nonlinear model is convex in the reciprocal of the rectifier's input signal power. Finally, we provide an example to show the advantages of applying the convex property in WPT network designs.},

abstract = {This paper considers an ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) network in which a full-duplex access point (FAP) simultaneously transmits downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals to its legacy user (LU) and receives uplink signals backscattered from multiple wireless-powered backscatter devices (BDs) in a time-division-multiple-access manner. To maximize the system throughput and ensure fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum throughput among all BDs by jointly optimizing the backscatter time and reflection coefficients of the BDs, and the FAP's subcarrier power allocation, subject to the LU's throughput constraint, the BDs' harvested-energy constraints, and other practical constraints. However, the formulated problem is non-trivial to solve in general, since the variables are mutually coupled and result in non-convex constraints. We thus propose an iterative algorithm by leveraging the block coordinated decent and successive convex optimization techniques. We further show the convergence performances of the proposed algorithm and analyze its complexity. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed joint design achieves significant throughput gain as compared to the benchmark schemes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in downlink multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where the users harvest energy and decode information using the same signals received from a fixed access point (AP). For information transmission, we consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). At the receiver side, due to the practical limitation that circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly, each user applies either time switching (TS) or power splitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ TS at the receivers; for the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS at the receivers. Under the above two scenarios, we address the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency power allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested energy constraint on each user as well as a peak and/or total transmission power constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate variable transformation the problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal power allocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS scheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation, subcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS ratio for each user. The performances of the two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically for the special case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power constraint imposed on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system play key roles in the rate-energy performance comparison by the two proposed schemes. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The capacity of noncoherent time-selective Rayleigh-fading channels is studied under various models for the variations in time. The study includes both single-input and single-output (SISO) and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A block-fading model is first considered where the channel changes correlatively over each block period of length T, and independently across blocks. The predictability of the channel is characterized through the rank Q of the correlation matrix of the vector of channel gains in each block. This model includes, as special cases, the standard block-fading model where the channel remains constant over block periods (Q = 1), and models where the fading process has finite differential entropy rate (Q = T). The capacity is initially studied for long block lengths and some straightforward but interesting asymptotes are established. For the case where Q is kept fixed as T → ∞, it is shown that the non-coherent capacity converges to the coherent capacity. For the case where both T, Q → ∞, with Q/T being held constant, a bound on the capacity loss due to channel unpredictability is established. The more interesting scenario of large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is then explored in detail. For SISO systems, useful upper and lower bounds on the large SNR asymptotic capacity are derived, and it is shown that the capacity grows logarithmically with SNR with a slope of T/T-Q, for Q {\textless} T. Next, in order to facilitate the analysis of MIMO systems, the rank-Q block-fading model is specialized to the case where each T-symbol block consists of Q subblocks of length L, with the channel remaining constant over each subblock and changing correlatively across subblocks. For this model, it is shown that the log SNR growth behavior of the capacity is the same as that of the standard block-fading model with block length L. Finally, the SISO and MIMO channel models are generalized to allow the fading process to be correlated across blocks in a stationary and ergodic manner. It is shown that the log SNR growth behavior of the capacity is not affected by the correlation across blocks. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = {In a superimposed unicast and multicast transmission system, one layer of Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is required at each receiver to remove the multicast stream before decoding the unicast stream. In this paper, we show that a linearly-precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) strategy at the transmitter can efficiently exploit this existing SIC receiver architecture. By splitting the unicast message into common and private parts and encoding the common parts along with the multicast message into a super-common stream decoded by all users, the SIC is used for the dual purpose of separating the unicast and multicast streams as well as better managing the multi-user interference between the unicast streams. The precoders are designed with the objective of maximizing the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) of the unicast messages subject to a Quality of Service (QoS) requirement of the multicast message and a sum power constraint. Numerical results show that RS outperforms existing Multi-User Linear-Precoding (MU-LP) and power-domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) in a wide range of user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions and channel strengths). Moreover, since one layer of SIC is required to separate the unicast and multicast streams, the performance gain of RS comes without any increase in the receiver complexity compared with MU-LP. Hence, in such non-orthogonal unicast and multicast transmissions, RS provides rate and QoS enhancements at no extra cost for the receivers.},

A harvest-then-transmit protocol is assumed where the AP first broadcasts wireless power to all users via energy beamforming in the downlink (DL), and then, the users send their independent information to the AP simultaneously in the uplink (UL) using their harvested energy. To optimize the users' throughput and yet guarantee their rate fairness, we maximize the minimum throughput among all users by a joint design of the DL-UL time allocation, the DL energy beamforming, and the UL transmit power allocation, as well as receive beamforming. We solve this nonconvex problem optimally by two steps. First, we fix the DL-UL time allocation and obtain the optimal DL energy beamforming, UL power allocation, and receive beamforming to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of all users. This problem is shown to be still nonconvex; however, we convert it equivalently to a spectral radius minimization problem, which can be solved efficiently by applying the alternating optimization based on the nonnegative matrix theory. Then, the optimal time allocation is found by a one-dimensional search to maximize the minimum rate of all users. Furthermore, two suboptimal designs of lower complexity are also proposed, and their throughput performance is compared against that of the optimal solution.},

We develop a backscattering tag-to-tag network (BTTN), comprised of passive tags capable of large-scale, passive, and multihop communication with each other via backscatter modulation of an external RF excitation signal. The low sensitivity and lack of active demodulator on passive tags present significant challenges to the communication, including a unique phase cancellation problem, which significantly affects the range and robustness of a passive tag-to-tag link. We overcome these challenges using innovative tag architecture and also develop a novel multiphase backscatter modulation technique with a learning mechanism that overcomes the phase cancellation problem. This improves the link performance bringing passive tag-to-tag communication closer to practical use. The additional hardware compared to the conventional radio frequency identification tag architecture includes one more terminating impedance in the modulator. The data rate is reduced due to backscatter at two different phases while the increase in the power consumption is negligible. We develop prototype BTTN tag hardware and firmware and evaluate its performance. The prototype achieves link ranges of up to 3 m at 5 kb/s with an excitation power level of only-20 dBm while successfully overcoming phase cancellation. We further extend BTTN operation to a multihop network where we demonstrate a four hop link capable of communicating over 12 m under similar conditions.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have the potential to transform wireless communication channels into smart reconfigurable propagation environments. To realize this new paradigm, the passive IRSs have to be large, especially for communication in far-field scenarios, so that they can compensate for the large end-to-end path-loss, which is caused by the multiplication of the individual path-losses of the transmitter-to-IRS and IRS-to-receiver channels. However, optimizing a large number of sub-wavelength IRS elements imposes a significant challenge for online transmission. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a physics-based model and a scalable optimization framework for large IRSs. The basic idea is to partition the IRS unit cells into several subsets, referred to as tiles, model the impact of each tile on the wireless channel, and then optimize each tile in two stages, namely an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. For physics-based modeling, we borrow concepts from the radar literature, model each tile as an anomalous reflector, and derive its impact on the wireless channel for a given phase shift by solving the corresponding integral equations for the electric and magnetic vector fields. In the offline design stage, the IRS unit cells of each tile are jointly designed for the support of different transmission modes, where each transmission mode effectively corresponds to a given configuration of the phase shifts that the unit cells of the tile apply to an impinging electromagnetic wave. In the online optimization stage, the best transmission mode of each tile is selected such that a desired quality-of-service (QoS) criterion is maximized. We consider an exemplary downlink system and study the minimization of the base station (BS) transmit power subject to QoS constraints for the users. Since the resulting mixed-integer programming problem for joint optimization of the BS beamforming vectors and the tile transmission modes is non-convex, we derive two efficient suboptimal solutions, which are based on alternating optimization and a greedy approach, respectively. We show that the proposed modeling and optimization framework can be used to efficiently optimize large IRSs comprising thousands of unit cells.},

Employing a power splitting receiver, we derive closed-form analytical results including cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the harvested energy, CDF of the achievable rate, average harvested energy, and average achievable rate. We also investigate the effect of adjustable $\alpha$ factor in the proposed scheduling scheme and multiuser diversity in terms of the CDF of the harvested energy, the CDF of the achievable rate, and rate-energy tradeoff, compared with two conventional scheduling schemes: random scheduling and max-SNR scheduling. Our analytical results provide insightful information for designing multiuser scheduling criteria considering co-channel interference in the SWIPT systems.},

In WPHetNets, where various kinds of nodes such as high-power base station (e.g., TV tower and macro base station) and small-power access point (e.g., WiFi access point) coexist, we aim to increase transmission range and support fair communication through internet-of-things (IoT) device cooperation. For this, we first propose long-range bistatic backscatter (BB)-aided cooperative transmission with two-device cooperation where ambient backscatter (AB) enables short-range information exchange in sequential mode between devices nearby under energy neutral operation, termed 'Cooperation mode'. To ensure fairness between devices, we formulate common-throughput maximization problem where an algorithm for time allocation is presented. Compared with 'Non-cooperation mode' (i.e., no information exchange via AB) and active RF based cooperation schemes, the proposed scheme is shown to increase both the coverage and fairness between devices for battery-less IoT networks. We then generalize the architecture of backscatter-aided cooperative transmission with multiple-device cooperation where the information exchange is performed in sequential mode and parallel (broadcasting) mode. In the sequential mode, a graph-matching based suboptimal pairing algorithm is proposed whose validity is corroborated through comparison with a heuristic search based optimal pairing, and then we compare the two modes for multiple-device cooperation.},

abstract = {The recently completed 5G new radio standard is a result of several cutting-edge technologies, including massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter (mm)-Wave communication and network densification. However, these technologies face two main practical limitations 1) the lack of control over the wireless channel, and 2) the high power consumption of the wireless interface. To address the need for green and sustainable future cellular networks, the concept of reconfiguring wireless propagation environments using Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS)s has emerged. An IRS comprises of a large number of low-cost passive antennas that can smartly reflect the impinging electromagnetic waves for performance enhancement. This paper looks at the evolution of the reflective radio concept towards IRSs, outlines the IRS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication model and discusses how it differentiates from the conventional multi-antenna communication models. We propose a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) based channel estimation protocol for the design and analysis of IRS-assisted systems. Performance evaluation results at 2.5 GHz operating frequency are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed system.},

In terms of practice, a concrete way to design and prototype a wireless, batteryless, RF-powered, reconfigurable surface is offered and a proof-of-concept is experimentally demonstrated. It is also found that even with perfect channel estimation, the weak nature of backscattered links limits the performance gains, even for large number of surface elements. Impact of channel estimation errors is also studied. Future extensions at various carrier frequencies could be directly accommodated, through simple modifications in the antenna and matching network of each RFID tag/surface element.},

However, the JWIET in a general K-user MIMO interference channel (IFC) has been unexplored so far. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the JWIET in K-user MIMO IFC, in which receivers either decode the incoming information data (information decoding, ID) or harvest the RF energy (energy harvesting, EH). In the K-user IFC, we consider three different scenarios according to the receiver mode: i) multiple EH receivers and a single ID receiver, ii) multiple IDs and a single EH, and iii) multiple IDs and multiple EHs. For all scenarios, we have found a common necessary condition of the optimal transmission strategy and, accordingly, developed the transmission strategy that satisfies the common necessary condition, in which all the transmitters transferring energy exploit a rank-one energy beamforming. Furthermore, we have also proposed an iterative algorithm to optimize the covariance matrices of the transmitters that transfer information and the powers of the energy beamforming transmitters simultaneously, and identified the corresponding achievable rate-energy tradeoff region. Finally, we have shown that by selecting EH receivers according to their signal-to-leakage-and-harvested energy-ratio (SLER), we can improve the achievable rate-energy region further.},

The unique channel characteristics arising from multiple reflections at the IRS render the optimization problem highly non-convex. Therefore, we jointly utilize the minorization-maximization algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation technique to present an approximate solution for the optimal IRS phase shift design.

Numerical results indicate that the introduction of the IRS brings about considerable reductions in transmit power, even with moderate IRS sizes, which can be translated to range increases over the non-IRS-assisted BackCom system.},

abstract = {Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has emerged as a viable technique to energize and connect low-power autonomous devices and enable future Internet of Things (IoT). A major challenge of SWIPT is the energy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive low-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and energy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the received RF signal is first rectified before being used for information decoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF components such as local oscillators and mixers. This paper proposes a novel modulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on pulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of the pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's nonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the information can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the position of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the information and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for IntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we have established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping a base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT receiver including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was carried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and contrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental results highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to enhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with low-power consumption.},

The problem of modulation design for SWIPT has however been scarcely addressed. In this paper, a modulation scheme based on asymmetric phase-shift keying (PSK) is considered, which improves the SWIPT rate-energy trade-off region significantly. The nonlinear rectifier model, which accurately models the energy harvester, is adopted for evaluating the output direct current (DC) power at the receiver. The harvested DC power is maximized under an average power constraint at the transmitter and a constraint on the rate of information transmitted via a multi-carrier signal over a flat fading channel. As a consequence of the rectifier nonlinearity, this work highlights that asymmetric PSK modulation provides benefits over conventional symmetric PSK modulation in SWIPT and opens the door to systematic modulation design tailored for SWIPT.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop various beamforming techniques for downlink transmission for multiple-input single-output nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. First, a beamforming approach with perfect channel state information is investigated to provide the required quality of service for all users. Taylor series approximation and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques are employed to reformulate the original nonconvex power minimization problem to a tractable one. Furthermore, a fairness-based beamforming approach is proposed through a max-min formulation to maintain fairness between users. Next, we consider a robust scheme by incorporating channel uncertainties, where the transmit power is minimized while satisfying the outage probability requirement at each user. Through exploiting the SDR approach, the original nonconvex problem is reformulated in a linear matrix inequality form to obtain the optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the robust scheme can achieve better performance compared to the nonrobust scheme in terms of the rate satisfaction ratio. Furthermore, simulation results confirm that NOMA consumes a little over half transmit power needed by orthogonal multiple access for the same data rate requirements. Hence, NOMA has the potential to significantly improve the system performance in terms of transmit power consumption in future 5G networks and beyond.},

Starting from the fundamental theory of black-box optimization, the material progresses towards recent advances in structural optimization and stochastic optimization. Our presentation of black-box optimization, strongly influenced by Nesterov's seminal book and Nemirovski's lecture notes, includes the analysis of cutting plane methods, as well as (accelerated) gradient descent schemes. We also pay special attention to non- Euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging) and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA (to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term), saddle-point mirror prox (Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing), and a concise description of interior point methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss stochastic gradient descent, minibatches, random coordinate descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.},

abstract = {Previous studies have confirmed the adverse impact of fading correlation on the mutual information (MI) of two-dimensional (2D) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. More recently, the trend is to enhance the system performance by exploiting the channels degrees of freedom in the elevation, which necessitates the derivation and characterization of three-dimensional (3D) channels in the presence of spatial correlation. In this paper, an exact closed-form expression for the Spatial Correlation Function (SCF) is derived for 3D MIMO channels. The proposed method resorts to the spherical harmonic expansion (SHE) of plane waves and the trigonometric expansion of Legendre and associated Legendre polynomials. The resulting expression depends on the underlying arbitrary angular distributions and antenna patterns through the Fourier Series (FS) coefficients of power azimuth and elevation spectrums. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the SCF being valid for any 3D propagation environment. The developed SCF determines the covariance matrices at the transmitter and the receiver that form the Kronecker channel model. In order to quantify the effects of correlation on system performance, the information-theoretic deterministic equivalents of the MI for the Kronecker model are utilized in both mono-user and multi-user cases. Numerical results validate the proposed analytical expressions and elucidate the dependence of the system performance on azimuth and elevation angular spreads and antenna patterns. Some useful insights into the behavior of MI as a function of downtilt angles are provided. The derived model will help evaluate the performance of correlated 3D MIMO channels in the future.},

abstract = {This paper studies the coordinated beamforming design problem for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel, assuming only channel distribution information (CDI) known to the transmitters. Under a given requirement on the rate outage probability for receivers, we aim to maximize the system utility (e.g., the weighted sum rate, weighted geometric mean rate, and the weighed harmonic mean rate) subject to the rate outage constraints and individual power constraints. The outage constraints, however, lead to a complicated, nonconvex structure for the considered beamforming design problem and render the optimization problem difficult to handle. Although this nonconvex optimization problem can be solved in an exhaustive search manner, this brute-force approach is only feasible when the number of transmitter-receiver pairs is small. For a system with a large number of transmitter-receiver pairs, computationally efficient alternatives are necessary. Hence, the focus of this paper is the design of such efficient approximation methods. In particular, by employing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and first-order approximation techniques, we propose an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality approximate beamforming solutions via solving a sequence of convex approximation problems. The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a stationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming design problem. Furthermore, we propose a distributed SCA algorithm where each transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using local CDI and information obtained from limited message exchange with the other transmitters. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its distributed counterpart indeed converge, and promising performance can be achieved for all the considered system utilities. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

This paper investigates channel capacity and outage performance of ambient backscatter communication systems. Specifically, a calculation method is proposed to facilitate capacity analysis, and the ambient backscatter system capacities are derived in the case of four different RF signals. It is surprisingly found that the channel capacity is obtained when the RF signals are not equiprobably backscattered by tag, and that the capacity with complex Gaussian RF signals is not exactly twice that with real ones for the ambient backscatter communication systems. Then, the outage probability and its asymptotic value in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime are obtained. Since the exact outage expression consists of an infinite number of terms, a tight truncation error bound is derived to reasonably estimate the number of effective terms for numerical simulation. Finally, simulation results are provided to corroborate theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {Terahertz (THz) band provides huge bandwidth but the molecular absorptions in these frequencies cause high path losses in long-distance communications. Recently, multi-band ultra-massive MIMO (UM-MIMO) systems based on graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas have been proposed to overcome the distance problem. In the UM MIMO systems, the mutual coupling effect is a challenging problem because of the ultra-dense integration of the multi-band nano-antenna arrays. In this paper, a graphene-based frequency selective surface (FSS) is proposed to reduce the coupling effects in dense plasmonic nano-antenna arrays for multi-band UM MIMO systems. The performance of the proposed structure is evaluated by full-wave simulation for different cases. The results show that the FSS structure has a wide stopband (-15 dB bandwidth, approximately 43{\%}-50{\%}) from 1.1 to 1.7 THz. By inserting the FSS structure between nano-antennas, a high isolation coefficient of -25 dB with a 15 dB fall and an envelope correlation coefficient of less than 0.01 are achieved. The field distributions and the radiation patterns are also presented to confirm that the proposed FSS structure improves the performance of the array with negligible influence on the antenna itself. Moreover, the receiving mode simulation of the array is performed with the FSS structure. It is also asymptotically shown that the mutual coupling experienced by the nano-antenna with the FSS structure is negligible even in the presence of a very large number of closely integrated elements. Finally, the technological issues are discussed for practical implementations.},

Furthermore, combining wireless power transfer with information transmission has become more appealing. In the systems that apply radio signals the wireless power transfer has become a popular trend to harvest RF-radiated energy from received information signal in IoT devices. For those systems, design frameworks mainly deal with the trade-off between information capacity and energy harvesting efficiency. Therein various signaling design frameworks have been proposed for different system preferences between power and information. In addition to this, protecting the information part from potential eavesdropping activity in a service area introduces security considerations for those systems.

In this paper, we model a cooperative AmBC system from a spectrum- sharing perspective, where a cooperative receiver (C-RX) decodes the information from both a multi-antenna primary transmitter (PT) and a single-antenna secondary transmitter (i.e., tag). We consider two scenarios: first, the tag-symbol period equals the PT-symbol period; second, the tag-symbol period is an integer multiple of the PT-symbol period. For each scenario, we analyze the data rate via successive- interference-cancellation (SIC) based decoding, and formulate a problem to maximize the sum rate by optimizing the beamforming vector at the PT. The problems are transformed into semi-definite programming (SDP), and solved by using the technique of semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Furthermore, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of beamforming optimization. Numerical results show that the cooperative AmBC system can achieve a higher sum rate than a conventional point-to-point system without a backscatter tag.},

However, owing to the resource-limitations of passive tags, the efficient usage of multiple antennas at the reader is essential for both downlink excitation and uplink detection. This work targets at maximizing the achievable sum-backscattered-throughput by jointly optimizing the transceiver (TRX) design at the reader and backscattering coefficients (BC) at the tags. Since, this joint problem is nonconvex, we first present individually-optimal designs for the TRX and BC. We show that with precoder and combiner designs at the reader respectively targeting downlink energy beamforming and uplink Wiener filtering operations, the BC optimization at tags can be reduced to a binary power control problem. Next, the asymptotically-optimal joint-TRX-BC designs are proposed for both low and high signal-to-noise-ratio regimes. Based on these developments, an iterative low-complexity algorithm is proposed to yield an efficient jointly-suboptimal design. Thereafter, we discuss the practical utility of the proposed designs to other application settings like wireless powered communication networks and BSC with imperfect channel state information. Lastly, selected numerical results, validating the analysis and shedding novel insights, demonstrate that the proposed designs can yield significant enhancement in the sum-backscattered throughput over existing benchmarks.},

If the characteristic and minimum polynomials of the matrix A coincide with each other (which is the case for genetic matrices of all classes of general and special matrices that we consider), then the latter deterministic cost bound can be replaced by the randomized bound O(KA(2n)+n2+(n log2 n) log b) where KA(2n) denotes the cost of the computation of the 2n-1 vectors Aiv, i = 1,...,2n-1, maximized over all n-dimensional vectors v; KA(2n) = O(M(n) log n), for M(n) = o(n2.376) denoting the arithmetic complexity of n×n matrix multiplication. This bound on the complexity of the eigenproblem is optimal up to a logarithmic factor and implies much faster solution of the eigenproblem for the important special classes of matrices. In particular, we prove the bound O(n2 log n+(n log2 n) log b) on the randomized arithmetic complexity of the eigenproblem for generic matrices of the classes of n×n Toeplitz, Hankel, Toeplitz-like, Hankel-like and Toeplitz-like-plus-Hankel-like matrices. Then again, this bound is optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) for each of the latter classes of input matrices. We also prove similar nearly optimal upper bounds for the generic Cauchy-like, Vandermonde-like and sparse matrices. All our complexity estimates for the eigenproblem improve the known ones by order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Recently, joint wireless information and energy transfer (JWIET) methods have been proposed to relieve the battery limitation of wireless devices. However, the JWIET in a general K-user MIMO interference channel (IFC) has been unexplored so far. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the JWIET in K-user MIMO IFC, in which receivers either decode the incoming information data (information decoding, ID) or harvest the RF energy (energy harvesting, EH). In the K-user IFC, we consider three different scenarios according to the receiver mode: i) multiple EH receivers and a single ID receiver, ii) multiple IDs and a single EH, and iii) multiple IDs and multiple EHs. For all scenarios, we have found a common necessary condition of the optimal transmission strategy and, accordingly, developed the transmission strategy that satisfies the common necessary condition, in which all the transmitters transferring energy exploit a rank-one energy beamforming. Furthermore, we have also proposed an iterative algorithm to optimize the covariance matrices of the transmitters that transfer information and the powers of the energy beamforming transmitters simultaneously, and identified the corresponding achievable rate-energy tradeoff region. Finally, we have shown that by selecting EH receivers according to their signal-to-leakage-and-harvested energy-ratio (SLER), we can improve the achievable rate-energy region further.},

Frequency-domain equalization is applied to assist successive interference cancellation at the base-station. Two kinds of RS schemes, namely, fixed RS (FRS) and cognitive RS (CRS) schemes, are proposed to realize RS for uplink NOMA with the aim of improving user fairness and outage performance in delay-limited transmissions. Corresponding to the split data streams, transmit power is allocated in either a fixed or cognitive manner for the FRS and CRS schemes, respectively. Based on achievable rate region analysis, the benefits of applying RS to uplink NOMA for enhancing the user fairness and outage performance are revealed. A modified Jain's index is proposed to measure the user fairness for the considered delay-limited transmissions. Closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probabilities of the paired users, respectively, whereas the preferred system parameters are chosen based on asymptotic outage probability expressions. The enhanced user fairness and superior outage performance of the proposed RS schemes are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulation results.},

Here, we propose "digital metamaterials" in two steps. Firstly, we present "coding metamaterials" that are composed of only two kinds of unit cells with 0 and {$\backslash$pi} phase responses, which we name as "0" and "1" elements. By coding "0" and "1" elements with controlled sequences (i.e., 1-bit coding), we can manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves and realize different functionalities. The concept of coding metamaterial can be extended from 1-bit coding to 2-bit or more. In 2-bit coding, four kinds of unit cells with phase responses 0, {$\backslash$pi}/2, {$\backslash$pi}, and 3{$\backslash$pi}/2 are required to mimic "00", "01", "10" and "11" elements, which have larger freedom to control EM waves. Secondly, we propose a unique metamaterial particle which has either "0" or "1" response controlled by a biased diode. Based on the particle, we present "digital metamaterials" with unit cells having either "0" or "1" state. Using the field-programmable gate array, we realize to control the digital metamaterial digitally. By programming different coding sequences, a single digital metamaterial has distinct abilities in manipulating EM waves, realizing the "programming metamaterials". The above concepts and physical phenomena are confirmed by numerical simulations and experiments through metasurfaces.},

We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power transferred to all EH receivers subject to given minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at different ID receivers. In particular, we consider two types of ID receivers (referred to as Type I and Type II, respectively) without or with the capability of cancelling the interference from (a priori known) energy signals. For each type of ID receivers, we formulate the joint information and energy transmit beamforming design as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). First, we obtain the globally optimal solutions for our formulated QCQPs by applying an optimization technique so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). It is shown via SDR that under the condition of independently distributed user channels, no dedicated energy beam is used for the case of Type I ID receivers to achieve the optimal solution; while for the case of Type II ID receivers, employing no more than one energy beam is optimal. Next, we establish a new form of the celebrated uplink-downlink duality for our studied downlink beamforming problems, and thereby develop alternative algorithms to obtain the same optimal solutions as by SDR. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of proposed optimal beamforming designs for MISO SWIPT systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Passive and semipassive UHF RF identification (RFID) systems have traditionally been designed using scalar-valued differential radar cross section (DRCS) methods to model the backscattered signal from the tag. This paper argues that scalar-valued DRCS analysis is unnecessarily limiting because of the inherent coherence of the backscatter link and the complex-valued nature of load-dependent antenna-mode scattering from an RFID tag. Considering modulated backscatter in terms of complex-valued scattered fields opens the possibility of quadrature modulation of the backscatter channel. When compared with binary amplitude shift keying (ASK) or phase shift keying (PSK) based RFID systems, which transmit 1 bit of data per symbol period, and thus 1 bit per on-chip clock oscillator period, tags employing vector backscatter modulation can transmit more than 1 bit per symbol period. This increases the data rate for a given on-chip symbol clock rate leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended read range. Alternatively, tags employing an -ary modulator can achieve higher data throughput at essentially the same dc power consumption as a tag employing binary ASK or PSK. In contrast to the binary ASK or PSK backscatter modulation employed by passive and semipassive UHF RFID tags, such as tags compliant with the widely used ISO18000-6c standard, this paper explores a novel CMOS-compatible method for generating -ary quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) backscatter modulation. A new method is presented for designing an inductorless -ary QAM backscatter modulator using only an array of switched resistances and capacitances. Device-level simulation and measurements of a four-state phase shift keying (4-PSK)/four-state quadrature amplitude modulated (4-QAM) modulator are provided for a semipassive (battery-assisted) tag operating in the 850-950-MHz band. This first prototype modulator transmits 4-PSK/4-QAM at a symbol rate of 200 kHz and a bit rate of 400 kb/s at a static power dissipation of only 115 nW. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {While two-way communication can improve the spectral efficiency of wireless networks, distances from the relay to the two users are usually asymmetric, leading to excessive wireless energy at the nearby user. To exploit the excessive energy, energy harvesting at user terminals is a viable option. Unfortunately, the exact gain brought by wireless power transfer (WPT) in two-way communication is currently unknown. To fill this gap, in this paper, the achievable rate region of wirelessly powered two-way communication with a fixed relay is derived. Not only this newly established result is shown to enclose the existing achievable rate region of two-way relay channel without energy harvesting but also the gain is precisely quantified. On the other hand, it is well-known that a major obstacle to WPT is the path-loss. By endowing the relay with mobility, the distances between the relay and users can be varied, thus providing a potential solution to combat pathloss at the expense of energy for transmission. To characterize the consequence brought by such a scheme, a pair of inner and outer bounds to the achievable rate region of wirelessly powered two-way communication under a mobile relay is further derived. By comparing the exact achievable rate region for the fixed relay case and the achievable rate bounds for the mobile relay case, it is possible to quantify the relative advantage of spending energy on moving versus on transmission in wirelessly powered two-way communication.},

Unlike the existing works on multi-carrier uplink NOMA, in which each user is assumed to access only one subcarrier, we consider a more general scenario where the number of subcarriers allocated to a single user is not constrained. We first aim to maximize the system's sum rate, which requires selecting the appropriate subcarriers for each user and distribute the transmission power. The formulated non-convex problem is transformed into a convex one, and further, an optimal and low-complexity iterative water-filling solution is proposed. Nonetheless, it is shown that maximum transmit power is employed by each user to maximize the sum rate. Motivated by the fact that the users are power constrained, the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is also studied. Based on fractional programming, the EE maximization problem is transformed into a series of sum rate maximization subproblems, and the proposed iterative water-filling solution is applied to each subproblem. The proposed schemes are compared with other NOMA-based and orthogonal multiple access based algorithms, and its superiority is fully validated.},

In this paper, we study the computation of multiple linear functions of Gaussian sources over-the-air using antenna arrays at both the IoT devices and the IoT access point (AP). The key challenges in this paper are the intranode interference of multiple functions, the nonuniform fading between different IoT devices and the massive channel state information (CSI) required at the IoT AP. We propose a novel transmitter design at the IoT devices with zero-forcing beamforming to cancel the intranode interference and uniform-forcing power control to compensate the nonuniform fading. In order to avoid massive CSI requirement, receive antenna selection is adopted at the IoT AP and a corresponding signaling procedure is proposed utilizing the 'OR' property of the wireless channel. The performance of the proposed transceiver design is analyzed. The closed-form expression for the mean squared function error (MSFE) outage is derived. Due to the complexity of the expression, an asymptotic analysis of the MSFE outage is further provided to demonstrate the diversity order in terms of the transmit power constraint and the number of IoT devices.

Recently, ambient backscattering that leverages existing RF signal resources in the air has been invented to empower data communication among low-power devices. In this paper, we introduce hybrid device-to-device (D2D) communications by integrating ambient backscattering and wireless-powered communications. The hybrid D2D communications are self-sustainable, as no dedicated external power supply is required. However, since the radio signals for energy harvesting and backscattering come from external RF sources, the performance of the hybrid D2D communications needs to be optimized efficiently. As such, we design two mode selection protocols for the hybrid D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible adaptation to the environment. We then introduce analytical models to characterize the impacts of the considered environment factors, e.g., distribution, spatial density, and transmission load of the ambient transmitters, on the hybrid D2D communications performance. Extensive simulations show that the repulsion factor among the ambient transmitters has a non-trivial impact on the communication performance. Additionally, we reveal how different mode selection protocols affect the performance metrics.},

In contrast to traditional underwater acoustic modems, which need to generate power-consuming carrier signals, PAB nodes communicate by simply reflecting (i.e., backscattering) existing acoustic signals in the environment. This reflection-based approach enables them to communicate at net-zero power but also imposes significant constraints on their throughput and modulation schemes. We present PAB-QAM, the first underwater backscatter design capable of achieving higher-order modulation. PAB-QAM exploits the electro-mechanical coupling property of piezoelectric transducers to modulate their reflection coefficients. Specifically, by strategically employing reactive circuit components (inductors), we demonstrate how PAB-QAM nodes can modulate the phase and amplitude of acoustic reflections and realize higher-order and spectrally-efficient modulation schemes such as QAM. We designed and built a prototype of PAB-QAM and empirically evaluated it underwater. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that PAB-QAM can double the throughput of underwater backscatter without requiring additional power, spectrum, or cost. Looking ahead, such increased throughput paves way for various subsea IoT applications in ocean exploration, underwater climate monitoring, and marine life sensing.},

The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device's wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker's nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively gather the guarded data. Our experiments with different mobile devices show that the covert channel can achieve 1.6 bps and transmit as far as 2 meters. In a through-the-wall scenario, it can transmit up to 70 cm.},

abstract = {This paper considers a max-min rate optimization problem with practical non-linear energy harvesting (NLEH) in which a multi-antenna hybrid access point transfers power to the devices via energy beamforming (BF), followed by the devices sending their data simultaneously by consuming the harvested energy. Using a sigmoid NLEH model with sensitivity, we tackle the joint energy BF and time allocation problem in two steps by solving the NLEH-aware energy BF problem for given time allocation and then solving the convex time allocation problem formulated with the aforementioned energy BF solution. We propose several iterative methods to solve the non-convex energy BF problem with and without approximation of the NLEH function. In addition, we present an asymptotic energy BF problem for a large-antenna system that can be solved at low complexity. The results show that the algorithms developed with a simple NLEH approximation provide almost the same performance with the algorithms developed with the exact NLEH function. Furthermore, the sensitivity region of the NLEH should be considered more carefully than the saturation region in the max-min rate optimization problem.},

abstract = {User cooperation is an effective technique to tackle the severe near-far user unfairness problem in wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). In this paper, we consider a WPCN where two collaborating wireless devices (WDs) first harvest wireless energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then transmit their information to the HAP. The WD with the stronger WD-to-HAP channel helps relay the message of the other weaker user. In particular, we exploit the use of ambient backscatter communication during the wireless energy transfer phase, where the weaker user backscatters the received energy signal to transmit its information to the relay user in a passive manner. By doing so, the relay user can reuse the energy signal for simultaneous energy harvesting and information decoding (e.g., using an energy detector). Compared to active information transmission in conventional WPCNs, the proposed method effectively saves the energy and time consumed by the weaker user on information transmission during cooperation. With the proposed backscatter-assisted relaying scheme, we jointly optimize the time and power allocations on wireless energy and information transmissions to maximize the common throughput. Specifically, we derive the semi-closed-form expressions of the optimal solution and propose a low-complexity optimal algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem. By comparing with some representative benchmark methods, we simulate under extensive network setups and demonstrate that the proposed cooperation method effectively improves the throughput performance in WPCNs.},

Existing techniques for channel estimation are prohibitively complex and consume too much power to be integrated into milliwatt- or microwatt-class wirelessly powered devices. We show that power transfer can be optimized using a transponder's backscatter signal alone, without requiring channel estimation and power measurement circuitry on the transponder. A measurement-based proof of concept is presented, illustrating that for any linear backscatter transponder, power optimization based on the backscattered signal is equivalent to local measurement at the mobile device itself. Using an 8×8 MIMO transceiver array to optimize power delivery across 100 randomly chosen locations in our office environment, we observe an average WPT enhancement of 8.1 dB relative to an unoptimized transmitter configuration.

We then develop a new form of signal design for WPT, denoted as transmit diversity, that relies on multiple dumb antennas at the transmitter to induce fast fluctuations of the wireless channel. Those fluctuations boost the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency thanks to the energy harvester nonlinearity. In contrast with (energy) beamforming, transmit diversity does not rely on channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and does not increase the average power at the energy harvester input, even though it still enhances the overall end-to-end power transfer efficiency. Transmit diversity is also combined with recently developed (energy) waveform and modulation to provide further enhancements. The efficacy of the scheme is analyzed using physics-based and curve fitting-based nonlinear models of the energy harvester and demonstrated using circuit simulations, prototyping and experimentation. Measurements with two transmit antennas reveal gains of 50{\%} in harvested DC power over a single transmit antenna setup. The work (again) highlights the crucial role played by the harvester nonlinearity and demonstrates that multiple transmit antennas can be beneficial to WPT even in the absence of CSIT.},

To avoid the need of the instantaneous information, including the specific codes and the instantaneous channel state information of the backscatter links, and to optimize the transmit power and the BD reflection coefficients, we derive the asymptotic BD signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) by employing the large-dimension random matrix theory. We formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize the minimum asymptotic SINR among BDs with guaranteeing the primary target rate. By investigating the property of the problem, the original problem is transformed and solved by the proposed iterative-based algorithm.

We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the access point (AP) and passive beamforming at the RIS under the assumption that the RIS's state information is statistically known by the AP, and propose a high-quality suboptimal solution based on the alternating optimization technique. Moreover, a closed-form expression for the asymptotic outage probability of the proposed scheme in Rician fading is derived. The achievable rate of the proposed scheme is also investigated under the assumption that the transmitted symbols are drawn from a finite constellation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and reveal the effect of various system parameters on the achievable rate. It is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms, in terms of achievable rate, the conventional RIS-assisted system without information transfer.},

abstract = {In this paper, the problem of joint mode switching and power adaptation is studied for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) over a fading channel. The receiver dynamically switches between information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) modes while the transmitter dynamically adapts the transmit power. Considering the nonlinearity of practical EH circuits, a realistic nonlinear EH model is adopted rather than the idealistic linear EH model. To characterize the ultimate performance tradeoff between ID and EH, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average harvested energy under the constraints on the average achievable rate and the average transmit power, which is a nonconvex and combinatorial problem. To solve this problem, first, the optimal power adaptation scheme for the nonlinear EH receiver that operates only in the EH mode is proposed. Using this scheme, the jointly optimal solution for the mode switching and power adaptation is then derived. By comparing the obtained results to the existing results, various useful and interesting insights into the optimized SWIPT system with nonlinear EH are presented. An important insight into the impact of nonlinear EH is that, to exploit the high energy conversion efficiency of the nonlinear circuit, the EH mode has to be selected only in the moderate range of channel gains. Also, in the EH mode, the power has to be adapted to the short-term power threshold only for the moderate channel gains.},

Also, asymptotic outage behavior is characterized in the high transmit signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Our analysis shows that for the backscatter system, both parasitic and competitive schemes achieve the same outage probability which is irrelevant to the backscatter channels, whereas the commensal scheme can attain exactly the same asymptotic outage performance with the other two schemes at high transmit SNR. In addition, as the SNR threshold of the backscatter system approaches to zero, the three schemes can achieve the same outage performance for the backscatter system.

The optimization problem of maximizing Rate-Power (R-P) region is studied. Assuming that the Channel gain is known at both the receiver and the transmitter, and constraining to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel inputs determined only by their first and second moment statistics, an inner bound for the general problem is obtained. Notably, as a consequence of the harvester nonlinearity, the studied inner bound exhibits a tradeoff between the delivered power and the rate of received information.

abstract = {Traditional power supply cords have become less important because they prevent large-scale utilization and mobility. In addition, the use of batteries as a substitute for power cords is not an optimal solution because batteries have a short lifetime, thereby increasing the cost, weight, and ecological footprint of the hardware implementation. Their recharging or replacement is impractical and incurs operational costs. Recent progress has allowed electromagnetic wave energy to be transferred from power sources (i.e., transmitters) to destinations (i.e., receivers) wirelessly, the so-called wireless power transfer (WPT) technique. New developments in WPT technique motivate new avenues of research in different applications. Recently, WPT has been used in mobile phones, electric vehicles, medical implants, wireless sensor network, unmanned aerial vehicles, and so on. This review highlights up-to-date studies that are specific to near-field WPT, which include the classification, comparison, and potential applications of these techniques in the real world. In addition, limitations and challenges of these techniques are highlighted at the end of the article.},

abstract = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) is an emerging paradigm that will enable using wireless to its full potential in future networks, not only to convey information but also to deliver energy. Such networks will enable trillions of future low-power devices to sense, compute, connect, and energize anywhere, anytime, and on the move. The design of such future networks brings new challenges and opportunities for signal processing, machine learning, sensing, and computing so as to make the best use of the RF radiations, spectrum, and network infrastructure in providing cost-effective and real-time power supplies to wireless devices and enable wireless-powered applications. In this paper, we first review recent signal processing techniques to make WPT and wireless information and power transfer as efficient as possible. Topics include power amplifier and energy harvester nonlinearities, active and passive beamforming, intelligent reflecting surfaces, receive combining with multi-antenna harvester, modulation, coding, waveform, massive MIMO, channel acquisition, transmit diversity, multi-user power region characterization, coordinated multipoint, and distributed antenna systems. Then, we overview two different design methodologies: the model and optimize approach relying on analytical system models, modern convex optimization, and communication theory, and the learning approach based on data-driven end-to-end learning and physics-based learning. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach, especially when accounting for various nonlinearities in wireless-powered networks, and identify interesting emerging opportunities for the approaches to complement each other. Finally, we identify new emerging wireless technologies where WPT may play a key role -- wireless-powered mobile edge computing and wireless-powered sensing -- arguing WPT, communication, computation, and sensing must be jointly designed.},

The PBs transmit a sinusoidal continuous wave (CW) and the BNs reflect back a portion of this signal while harvesting the remaining part. A BN harvests energy from multiple nearby PBs and modulates its information bits on the composite CW through backscatter modulation. The analysis poses real challenges due to the double fading channel, and its dependence on the PPPs of both the BNs and PBs. However, with the help of stochastic geometry, we derive the coverage probability and the capacity of the network in tractable and easily computable expressions, which depend on different system parameters. We observe that the coverage probability decreases with an increase in the density of the BNs, while the capacity of the network improves. We further compare the performance of this network with a regular powered network in which the BNs have a reliable power source and show that for a very high density of the PBs, the coverage probability of the former network approaches that of the regular powered network.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a cost-effective solution for achieving high spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless networks by leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts. Prior works on IRS mainly consider continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult to implement due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this paper an IRS-Aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-Antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-Antenna users. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a given set of minimum signal-To-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in general. To tackle this problem, we first study the single-user case with one user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal algorithms for solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting elements, while a constant proportional power loss is incurred that depends only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs for the single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users among which some are aided by the IRS. Simulation results verify our performance analysis as well as the effectiveness of our proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.},

In particular, we consider a three-node system with one transmitter that broadcasts a common signal to separated information decoding (ID) and EH receivers. Owing to the nonlinearity of the EH receiver circuit, the efficiency of wireless power transfer depends significantly on the waveform of the transmitted signal. In this paper, we aim to answer the following fundamental question: What is the optimal input distribution of the transmit waveform that maximizes the rate of the ID receiver for a given required harvested power at the EH receiver? In particular, we study the capacity of a SWIPT system impaired by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) under average-power (AP) and peak-power (PP) constraints at the transmitter and an EH constraint at the EH receiver. Using Hermite polynomial bases, we prove that the optimal capacityachieving input distribution that maximizes the rate-energy region is unique and discrete with a finite number of mass points. Our numerical results show that the rate-energy region is enlarged for a larger PP constraint and that the rate loss of the considered SWIPT system compared to the AWGN channel without EH receiver is reduced by increasing the AP budget.},

abstract = {Radio waves carry both energy and information simultaneously. Nevertheless, radio-frequency (RF) transmissions of these quantities have traditionally been treated separately. Currently, the community is experiencing a paradigm shift in wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiation as well as the network infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. In this paper, we review and discuss recent progress in laying the foundations of the envisioned dual purpose networks by establishing a signal theory and design for wireless information and power transmission (WIPT) and identifying the fundamental tradeoff between conveying information and power wirelessly. We start with an overview of WIPT challenges and technologies, namely, simultaneous WIPT (SWIPT), wirelessly powered communication networks (WPCNs), and wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WPBC). We then characterize energy harvesters and show how WIPT signal and system designs crucially revolve around the underlying energy harvester model. To that end, we highlight three different energy harvester models, namely, one linear model and two nonlinear models, and show how WIPT designs differ for each of them in single-user and multi-user deployments. Topics discussed include rate-energy region characterization, transmitter and receiver architectures, waveform design, modulation, beamforming and input distribution optimizations, resource allocation, and RF spectrum use. We discuss and check the validity of the different energy harvester models and the resulting signal theory and design based on circuit simulations, prototyping, and experimentation. We also point out numerous directions that are promising for future research.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have received considerable attention from the wireless communications research community recently. In particular, as low-cost passive devices, IRSs enable the control of the wireless propagation environment, which is not possible in conventional wireless networks. To take full advantage of such IRS-assisted communication systems, both the beamformer at the access point (AP) and the phase shifts at the IRS need to be optimally designed. However, thus far, the optimal design is not well understood. In this paper, a point-to-point IRS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system is investigated. The beamformer at the AP and the IRS phase shifts are jointly optimized to maximize the spectral efficiency. Two efficient algorithms exploiting fixed point iteration and manifold optimization techniques, respectively, are developed for solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem. The proposed algorithms not only achieve a higher spectral efficiency but also lead to a lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art approach. Simulation results reveal that deploying large-scale IRSs in wireless systems is more efficient than increasing the antenna array size at the AP for enhancing both the spectral and the energy efficiency.},
